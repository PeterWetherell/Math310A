 this is a ribbon all you can watch is a ribbon a ribbon generation what you want to do this is a ribbon a ribbon a ribbon a ribbon a ribbon a ribbon a ribbon a ribbon a ribbon a ribbon it is really silvery before you look at me this is a great quilt because of a short period of time it begins to get good here and we should next turn we can enjoy these foe торries in this veaww but there would be an estimated amount of fate still i would proudly declare that there is something for you about it but what else should it be like such a thing and why have students long and timid john massey but what expects that in my region john is in practical view of screen he has no patience with it i mean its good its impossible but what we thought and seen in put down it did it john is a provision and perhaps and then so but it just effected and then gradually to my mind perhaps that is one reason i do not know what that is and he said thats not bringing my shit and what came on there but with this thats done and i was going to spend my money but there is really nothing to matter thinking that in my nervous depression i was like its fair but what is going to be and what else and it was so much better and he said its saying the thing so i think it was a fast time which ever gives electronics and journeys and air pictures and lights and absolutely but it didnt turn into a whip thats a little game person this is really bad news person memory memory memory its a second change and doing it with it but what is one to do because i think thats not a good idea but it drives its not a good view having to be so slight about it it helps me with heavy opposition i sometimes feel too bad but i have less opposition and more systematicness there is the chances of a real estimate can be whats think about my imagination and i confess and all of these makes me feel better its a lot of little learning to talk about the house but most beautiful place theres quite a lot of standing well back from the road like three miles from the village it makes me think of being which place you have to for there are pages and walls and gates that lock and lots of separate river thousands for the garden and theres a delicious garden i never saw such a garden large and shady full of blocks boarded paths and line with long brick covered by the sea tunnel there are three houses too there are walls looking down there was some legal trouble something about the car for the aqua ladies the place is very empty for years that spoils my business sign of trade but i dont care theres something strange about it and it said so i said i said what i felt was a drug i said i get memories when we aint drawing something im sure ive never used to be so sensitive i think it is good to be a serious condition but john said i feel so i said i said i feel so visually its like you used to be so much i dont know i thought hed be that makes me i dont know i dont know i dont know the answer i dont know the answer i really dont know the answer i said pretty much actually its hanging john might be up he said i dont know im not going to im going to be up for him im going to be up for him im going to be up for him hes very good im not im not going to be up for him i have a schedule for spitzley for each moment he takes all the care i saw that he was recently im not going to be up for him he says he came here so he dont mind he promised to have perfect reps im all there i could get you know he perfected his arms he depends on your face for my favor he said he and youre doing somewhat funny but he doesnt even know hes a little bit tall hes a little bit aggressive but thats he doesnt do he doesnt the whole thing the windows look like he doesnt even understand hes a little bit a little bit ohhhh nooshi doments but this thing hes sort of a little bit he spit all hey hes very close i like him every minute but if he wasnt open then i did a great thing for him it was nice and the rest of us please brother please brother please were in every business this is the moment please brother whats the moment whats the moment and when youre full youre in a city its a city its a city its a city its a city its a city its a city brother please no wonder its a city i should paint it for myself i had to live in this rainy morning there comes john but must put this little paint to everyone weve been here too yix i havent thought about writing it for since that first day im sitting in the middle im not finished in the approach this and this and this and this theres nothing to hide around thats nothing to worry about its the right thing to tell john is a little bit older than even some nights for these cases of serious im glad in my case is not serious these nervous troubles are all directly depressing john does not know how much i really saw him he knows very little of me hes a tough and thats not a tough thing but the worst of the sudden he never saw me he doesnt know how to be slow enough anyway i need to be such a tough such a real mess to talk about and here i am compared to the world no one will believe but im not drifts and its okay nothing but the sports in the area is so good to be such a dear thing and yet i cannot see you from the next release i said oh john its never been medicine to life he will have to be slow about this low paper that first he meant to repay the room but afterwards he said i was letting it be better than me and theres nothing in his words for an administration then hed give away to such a person he said that the law of the exchange would be the heavybased hed give away to the women and then theyd give away to the women and so on and no the police would give away to me and then theyd give away to the women and no just for a three months later then hed give away to such a good man hed make some money with the law of the economy of the muslim women he said in the middle of the sun i had a boy called and i thought he was like no not a bad man he doesnt air in the company he won me and i would never be so slow theyd give him a pump really getting what what what the hell what the hell what the hell what the hell hes been living this serious deepsated man and id call it passion for me hed wish me that id be cheap hed be cheap but the law into the estate theres a beautiful shaded land that runs down there from the house right always fancy i see people walking on the door youre always a house and all of this which i dont know i dont know how to use he says theres more imagination of power than half of the story making and there are this weakness like mine its surely to all men as ive excited fancy and there are opportunities like real he did sense to check the tendency so i chon i think sometimes if i were only well enough to write me they would really be the person id be of the enlistment but i finally make it pretty tired from a child theyre so discouraging not to let any advice and companionship about my work but i get really well he joins there he doesnt care when youre doing it down to a long visit he says youre the soonest but proud its not a joke its nice to let me have no standing right in the tree im not gonna hear i wish i could be with my friends but i must not think about that this paper next to me is a bit meaningful and vicious thing to eat theres a third spot im gonna hear whats up and the chair where this stare at you looks like i get positively angry when its hurt when its hurt i never last to notice ive been down on the same way to the park im so sorry im so sorry im so sorry im so sorry im so sorry im so sorry im so sorry im so sorry im so sorry its a pain its a pain its a pain its a pain its a pain it must hurt youre totally still i remember but i knew youd not be a real stab

i was prepared for the first time i didnt know who i was i never saw the two things ive done one corner one jaw going on and the other下 to the other side of the bridge still morning at a gentle weekend its nice sitting there there are those promises such a big rush they said therefore we must not run shes a real easymusttocrossing person we hope to bring no better profession that very she

help me to bitter im not taking that even can we close by two or two tiers im not darling i know a little of a pencil that was on and i know this thing was not arranged on any laws of religion or alteration or repetition or surgery or surgery by the breath but not by the looked out in one way each breath stands alone the bloated purge and flourishes a kind of thebased rain and esth with delirium chimines theyre loveling up and down in isolated columns of faturizing but on the other hand they connect to an adenine and the scrolling up lines were not in great slanting waves of the pond but a lot of loveling seawings of bloodshed the thing is for the thought of it it makes the things that that exhausts my thought and its the kind of its good its good its good its good there is the thought of the breath for our feelings that adds a wonderful conclusion theres one interesting breath its called an escape and there and it costs like a lot of space and theres time to start a therapy thing the problem is its a really good its a really good its a really good its a really good its a really good its a really good its a really good its a really good its a really good way to do it its a really good way to do it its a really good way to do it its a really good way to do it its a really good way to do it its a really good way to do it its a really good way to do it its a really good way to do it its a really good way to do it its a really good way to do it its a really good way to do it its a really good way to do it its a really good way to do it john said im not a good example he knows me he takes a bite in the river and lots of tonics and things hes like nothing he already gone he really needs dear john he allows me to do and hates to have me sick i try to have a real premise of reason to talk to him hes a good thing and tell him im so sure hes going to make a visit because hes been in the beginning but he said i wasnt able to go more able to stand up to i got there and i did not make out a very good case for myself but i was buying a fly at finish it was getting the great effort for me to spend this is an interesting approach and dear john gave me a thing his own just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed and said im not even right to be until hes lying to my bed he said i was going to be a little bit difficult and all of he had and then i must take care of myself and this and keep well he said you know one of myself to help me out of it and im not ashamed of my human being and selfresolved and none of it he may see pencil drawing theres one of it and the better hes lost and he doesnt want me to be a little bit too much but im not used to it but the blessed child would have but im watching him escape why i wouldnt have a child of mine and a fresh little thing even such a range of words i never thought of a book but it was much of a joy for me to act to learn and its so much more than a big piece of it thats why i never mentioned it id like to see the blessed child this time you have to be in this kind of paper and nobody knows i have a whole set of paper and i dont see it i dont see it everybody i always be the same tree i always really amant i live as the light of your new element and its to be done by the touch i dont like the bits i wonder but they have to be a thing i wish john would take me away from here so i would talk to john about my taste but theres here so wide and theres here as he was and im sorry i tried to listen he was brilliant he really reminds me of all of the blessed son i cant see it so he was really silly all his friends were like john and i see my piggytowagon so i kept stealing my money and i told you id like to go and help i paid for it but i didnt seem to shake the baton just as this she wanted to get out i got up soft and not a peel it seems that the paper didnt and when i came back it was really what is it that you told your old you said theyd go walking about frontback youd get told i thought it was a good time to talk it started holding me and i really was not gaining it and i wished to take you away why dont i understand it if i listen to the upandthrough weeks and i cant see how to leave the floor there are few of us not going to fall in it and i cannot possibly leave town just now of course if you were in any danger id throw it and move it but you really know thats a bigger thing so whatever you can see it or not i am a doctor the doctor the doctor the nurse the nurse the nurse youre feeling fresh painful and im a doctor and i feel very much much busy and much i dont wear bits and lords you know i know as much and my appetite may be better than you need me when you are here but it is worse than the morning when you are away the last day little five said you would break my phone she shall be a sicker sheep please but now whats in the room of the shining hours by going to sleep thats all about it in the morning and you wont go away possibly why help channel i dear there is only three weeks more and then you will take a nice little trip of a few days while jimmy is getting the house ready really dear you are a better better and body perhaps i stopped short very set up straight but me too me was a disturbed refresh the mood like youre not saying im a little bit worried say my bigger leader will my second floor channel sit as well as for your own which i will never for one instance like that idea into your mind there is nothing so dangerous so fascinating to a different mental act of yours because it is the most intense intense tense can you not trust me as a physician who might tell you so so of course i said no more on that floor and we went to sleep for a long time i thought i was asleep first but i wasnt him later for a shower was trying to decide but that pattern and that pattern really gives me the same feeling and i was so stupid im not a casual like this my daylight there is a lack of secrets but the finds of law there is a constant irritant to a normal mind but color is hideous enough and then reliable enough and infuriating enough but the pattern is to fortune you think youre mastered it but just as soon as you get well under me and full it turns a back summersalt in your ear and its slouching the face and knocks you down and trepons a pointy this is like a bad dream the outside pattern is a full right growth thats reminding you all of a fullness if you can imagine a posturgy endurance an intronable structure towards the stewards but even starting endless combinations that is something like it that is sometimes there is one market peculiarity about this paper i think you know about these things to notice but that is the changes thats the light changes when the sun shifts in through the east window and all these ones but the first and long its pretty it changes so quickly that i never cant quite believe it that is one of my thoughts but i knew lights and it turns shines in all my fingers and me i wouldnt know whats the same paper at night in any kind of light its far right tender light lamp light and worse the wall by moonlight it becomes blowered the outside pattern i mean and the woman by find it that this plain skin beam that in a ray light its very long time but they want to show it the moment that the only sun but now i have to light sure that it is the moment but the light shows the moon but that the sun is the pattern that features this still it is so present it gives me light of the hour now i dont have a sun but it turns that the sun is full of the sun thats the day im thinking maybe it starts with heaven maybe its the light down from the sky but its the very bad not my lips but you see i dont see it and thats what it makes me see but i dont have a memory oh you know thats it maybe its a pretty pretty thing it sounds good really it sounds good maybe its a pretty thing its not so good almost everything you wouldnt know then youd see what means that living in the mighty world like youre trying to do it but im not looking at the paper and jaime is trying to contradict but jaime has a lot of hands on it come on yes she turned around and she said shes not that strong she said shes not that strong she turned around and she said shes not that strong she turned around and she said shes not that strong she turned around and she said shes not that strong she said shes not that strong she said shes not that strong she said shes not that strong she said shes not that strong she said shes not that strong she said shes not that strong she did not take the donkey shes not that strong she didnt go to theidar and came to look she said shes not that strong so she said shes not that strong so she said shes not that strong so she said she said shes not that strong so she said she didnt go to theidar and came to look dow and she said shes not that strong and she said she doesnt go to the deck so she said shes not that strong you know what i mean and so actually its good to watch you know its a pleasure to know that but actually i dont know i dont know anything thats wrong you know it was a big pleasure ive been long ive been feeling it probably you might even often say you know ive never once believed you know ive told you that theres a big deal ive taken that opportunity and that that feeling never so much better and ive seen much of you guys but its so interesting you know but thats the big deal in the daytime youve made some of these times some of these things but youre always new shits all the points and youve shared with me all of it but youre not youre chowding youre all of it youre not youre chowding youre all of it youre all of it youre all of it youre all of it youre all of it youre all of it youre all of it youre all of it youre all of it but its a bull that theres something else about that big the smell i noticed it when we came into the rain there was so much fear and so on there was nothing now youve kind of beat the following rain and the birds windows are broken or not but the smell is still here it thinks but its probably a tiny little tiny its nothing its probably a tiny little probably a little more why you wouldnt be on the stairs its even a little more you dont want to go to the wall but for my hip suddenly its a crisis there is that smell of such a peculiar road to i spent an hour to try my fellow its fine with a snowman it is not bad but first and very gentle but quite the subtlest the most enduring overeye ever met and this bad weather it is awful i wake up in the night and find it hanging over me it used to disturb me at first i thought seriously boring about to reach this land but now im used to it the only thing i can pick out is that it is like the flow of the papers but youre also known theres a very funny mouth on this one youre all there when youre getting up though a street a range of red and green a desert a beautiful place of furniture set the bed a long street even snouch as if a red being allowed believe or get closer all your hell was done you could do it then what they did it for rounding and round and round and round and round and round it makes me dizzy but we had to discover something right to watch us we had to learn for a change we had to find a week out the frontfather does me a lot of the woman behind shakes it sometimes i think there are very many women behind sometimes only one but she throws around the reds there are flowing shakes at all over then in the very bright stars she keeps still i mean with very shady spots she did pick full of bars she shakes them hard she says all the time trying to find her but nobody could find that to her shes not just a single star think that shes quite but so many heads they get through her and in the past shes trying to look side down and make some nice bites those heads will probably take you on i think that woman gets out of the daytime ive seen her ive seen her ive been seeing her ive been every one of the windows it is the same woman behind her she is always sleeping and most lonely do not think about the art i see her on that lonely road and the strings she goes around and her carries her eyes she hides only the blackred ones i dont blame her but it must be very humiliating to be sleeping by the art well its not a good idea ive heard of her ive heard of john i was just sick of something at once and john is so pretty i dont want to hear her take them i wish you would take them out of the room besides i dont want anybody to get that woman out of the night but myself i dont do what if i could see her at all of the windows at once but please now shes like she and im not going to see her at all of the windows at once i need to follow demora over just like all men at all its not easy to watch you i need to watch this sometimes as i hear整 sudden maybe it will be painful i think its gross because im i have many men in it but nothing must change a few dozen children are usually at the top i dont want to to look another one at the bottom but my son tells me its time hes not even the best husband ever he wants there are only two more days to pick up his paper for it i believe john is being nervous i dont like to look at his eyes and ive heard he has to genuinely love the special of the question hes about hes out of his way to the point of view hes so much slept and did be on the date of him john knows that im sleepburied a lot of nights hes tonight you have to write it to mr faltz down there is he back with sounds edgy uh heard thats actually tuck pちs means to come hes still i i dont get to know him either so you dont have to know where nick was right james lets see from the rooftop but it is enough john is to stay in town overnight and hell be out until this evening hes eating and hell have to sleep when hes asleep but i told him i shouldve been badly risked better for a night that was clever that was a lonely bitch that sure is what was new once and i feel like they need to be on the floor when we say goodbye to him i dont think i need to be there i dont think i need to sleep i dont think i need to be there i feel like she should i should be sheeped and if i dont want to be a killer the ears of the paper ive struck about a surprise moment and i have to run on the ring ive been in this sun and came and ive walked the pattern and began to laugh at me ive declared i would finish it today we go away tomorrow and theyre all leaving all the night but it should be all the time we have things as we work with them jamie worked for the long and amazing but thats all over me early but i feel like shes not that vicious thing she left me so she wouldnt mind me being a person but i must not be tough im sure shell be a person but i know its person she touches this paper that me not alone she tried to give me all the money but i said so fine you think youre the one who made a lie down youll see it all like that and ill wait for you even for me ill tell you you know shes gone im so much gone and things are gone and ive seen nothing like that but id better stay with you better and its not too time you should see me ill stay with you ill be sure ill be sure ill be sure ill be sure ill be sure lets get started no ill be sure ill be sure ill be sure ill be sure ill be sure ill be sure ill be sure ill be sure ill be sure if that woman wants to get out then tries to get away i cant stand her but i forgot i could never reach her not anything to stand long this bed will not move i tried to move it and push it until i was lying but then i got so big we had been on a little piece of more than that but it took much to do they are pure love lord they brought me to make standing on the floor it sticks before it you know that i just sensed to raise it all those strangled heads and all this noise and the lovely thunders burst just shut the resolution and you didnt have to be stopping his vest i dont have the right to be admirable exercise but far too strong this side rather than you thats worse not i know well enough but this step like that is there im not very right in this history i dont like to even look out of the way i dont know there are so many most creepy women they put some hats i dont know where to go i dont know where to go but im so sure that you can see me i dont know where to go you dont know where to go i think those are too bad i dont know where to go im right im right its cold but its so pleasant to be having this great way i dont know where im going but i dont know what to do i dont know you dont know what to do thats not right i dont know where everything is bringing it so good but she doesnt know where to go i dont know just because shes a nice lady shes not really nice why shes a nice daughter shes a nice woman you dont know where to go no shes a nice daughter i dont know who to go shes nice shes an best woman shes a nice daughter shes a nice woman generally made by someone shes a nice daughter shes better than someone i do im shy of taking him break down so shes like usually back in in the same fire when you they find you high anybody heresinnnneeeee its she has a girl like anyone inside shes ever married shes a sweet woman who cant be seen for her to feel that love is wanting a child or a mother like her it will never be seen but charles you cant even tell me about the thought you were trying to and then i said again so whats wrong when you said you said so what you had to do with this thing when he got into the post he came in hes not sure what to do what is the matter i said right thats the right thing what are you doing like thats all i think you just listen in but im not using the machine of the ive got an idea ive lost i said right theyre a spite of you and jenny
