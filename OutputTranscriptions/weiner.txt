 This is a little bit of a trip for you. I hope you are watching this video. For more information or to volunteer, please visit www.librivales.org. According to the following law, www.myspace.mature.definite. The yellow wall of the building is a Charlotte-Presentee. It is very seldom in here ordinary people like John and myself such as your ancestral hall which I will show you. This is a colonial mansion, a hereditary estate. I would say a haunted house and meets the height of a manic felicity, but that would be asking too much of fate. Still, I would proudly declare that there is something fear about it. Else, why else should it be left so cheaply? And why have stilts along intimidated John Lafse from their place? But one expects that in marriage. John is practical and extreme. He has no patience with faith, an intense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures. John is a physician and perhaps, I would not say to a living soul, of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my mind. Perhaps that is one reason I did not get well faster. You see, he does not believe I am sick in what came under him. A physician and high-street, and one's own husband, assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing to matter with one, but temporary nervous depression, a slight hysteria and tendency. What is one to be? My brother is also a physician and also an ice-creamer, and he says the same thing. Do I take phosphates or phosphides? Whichever it is. Antonics and journeys and air and exercise and an absolutely forbidden to work until I am well again. Personally, I disagree with their ideas. Personally, I believe in a continuum with excitement and change and a do-me-gold. With what is one to do? I did write for a while in spite of them, but it does exhaust me of them. Putting this aside, it helps me with my condition. I sometimes fancy that my condition, if I had less opposition and more society and stimulus, but John says the very worst thing I can do is think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad. So I will let it alone and talk about the house. The most beautiful place. It is quite alone, standing well back from the road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English places that you read about, where there are hedges and walls and dates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people. There is a delicious garden. I never saw such a garden. Large and shady, full of box-boarded paths, and lined with long, red-colored arbezz with seats under them. There were greenhouses too, but they are all broken now. There was some legal trouble, I believe. Something about the hares and co-hairs. Anything that places a painting for years. That spoils my dorsaliness, I'm afraid. But I don't care. There is something strange about the house. I can feel it. I even said so to John. He said what I felt was a drop. I get unreasonable angry with John sometimes. I'm sure I never used to be so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition. But John says, if I feel so, I shall neglect proper self-control. So I take pains to control myself. Before him, at least. And that makes me very tired. I don't like our room, but this. I want to run downstairs and open on the piano side. And have roses all over the window. In such pretty old-fashioned, chipped paintings. With John with hot feathers. This shop was kind of a one-room, but not a room for two girls. And no mere room for them if it took another. I was very careful of nothing. And hardly let my spirit pass special directions. I'm a severe prescription for each power on the road. He takes all care from me. And so I feel basically unwaitful not to value him. He said he came here so real-night. If I was to have perfect rest and all the air I could get. Your exercise depends on your strength, my dear, said he. And your food somewhat on your appetite. But air you can absorb all the time. So we took the nursery at the top of the house. It is a big, airy room. The whole floor in here. With windows that look all waves. And air and sunshine below. It was nursery first, and then playroom and gymnasium, I should judge. Where the windows are barred from the little children. And there are reams of things in the walls. The paint on paper looked as if a boy's school had used it. It is stripped off the paper. In great patches all around the head of my bed. About as far as I could reach. And in a great place on both sides of the room. I never saw a vertical line. And a sprawling, flamboyant pattern. Committing every artistic scene. As the dull enough to confuse the eye of the father. Announced enough to constantly irritate and provoke study. And when you follow the lame, uncertain curves for a little distance. They suddenly commit suicide. Plunge off at outrageous angles. Destroy themselves and unheard of contradictions. The color is repellent. Armors revolting. A smoldering, unclean mellow. Strangely faded by the slow, tingly sunroof. It is a dull yet unruly harmony of some places. Sickly, self-retent knows. No wonder the children hated it. I should hate it myself if I had to live in this room long. There comes John. Unless we could just hear the new weeks' current write a word. We've been here two years. We haven't felt this right since that first year. I'm sitting by the window now. Up in this atrocious nursery. And there's nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please. I say black and strong. John is away all day. And even some nights when his faces are serious. I'm glad my face is not serious. But these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing. John does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no reason to suffer. And that satisfies him. Of course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my duty in any way. I meant to be such a help to John. Such a real rest and comfort. And here I am a comparative burden already. No one would believe what an effort it would take to deal with a little I-a-a-dress and entertainer. And other things. It is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby. And yet I cannot deal with him. Makes me so nervous. I suppose John was never nervous in his life. He laughs at me so about this wallpaper. At first he meant to re-paper the room. But afterwards he said that I was letting it get the better of me. And that nothing is worse for a nervous patient than to give way to such funsays. And he said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy bedspread and then the barred windows and then the gate ahead of the stairs and so on. You know the place is doing you good, you see. And really dear. I don't care to renovate the house just for a three-months rental. Then do let us go down the stairs. There are such pretty women there. Then he took me in his house and called me a blessed little goose. And said he would go down to the south and have a bright, bright stage of life. But he is not here. He is in the house. He is in the house. He is standing around here. He comes and he is walking. But he will not be a safe place. He will not be a safe place. He really didn't fight the farm. He fought the farm. At one point, like this, there was mysterious addition to the farm. There was a big addition to the farm. And there was a big addition to the farm. I have a note that in the ugly view of the road in a little private court belonging to the estate there is a beautiful shaded room with a rose-bed view of the house. I always fancy a steep, walking, and numerous paths and corridors. But John is cautioned not to be rude and offensive. He said, I am not a gentle person. I am not a historian. I know this weakness, but not I am sure to know that all men are kind of subtle princesses. And that I ought to be kind of a princess. I am a gentle person. So I'll tell you. I think sometimes, if I were only willing to write I would leave the press for ideas and lessons. But I find I would be pretty tired from the time. I was so discouraged not to have any advice and companionship about my work. When I get really well, John says he will ask President Finlay and Julia to come for a long visit. He says he will assume he could fire words in my pillowcase. As to let me have those stimulating people, I don't know. I wish I could go fast. But I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it knew what a vicious confidant is. There is a recurrent spot where I have any words on the broken record. The true bird is tired of scourging for so long. I get positively angry with the impertinent others. And the everlastingness. Up and down in the sideways they call. And those absurd, ungrieving eyes are everywhere. There is one little place for two breaths that will match. And the eyes go all up and down the line. And one more little tired than the other. We have a sauce on which expression in the air. And we all know how much expression in the air. We use the wide wings of the child. And get no more into a team than the terrible. The wonderful, wonderful, and the wonderful things. The most children are no more to us from the world. I remember a kinder link in lives about a good old year in the start. And we are at one time all the same strong and proud. And we used to be a couple. We never had a bunch of bunch of people. And we were called to stop in the dungeon and do the same. The furniture in this room is more worse than in our menu this time. But we had to bring it all up and down in the stairs. I suppose when this was used as a playroom, we had to take the nursery things out. And no wonder. I never saw such ravages as the childrens have made here. The wallpaper that I sit before is torn off in spots. And it's sticking close to my brother. And I say, Mr. Williams, what's the matter with you? I'm going to destroy you. I'm going to destroy you. I'm going to destroy you. I'm going to destroy you. I'm going to destroy you. I'm going to destroy you. I'm going to destroy you. There comes down a sister. Such a dear girl she is. And so carefully, I must not find a fight with her. She is a perfect and a piece of her stethoscope. And yet, with no better proficiency, I believe in her. She thinks it is the right thing to do with her. But I can write what she is saying. I've been using her long enough to do this. There's one thing that is better. I love this shape of her. I know that she is hot. She's hot. There she is. She's pretty. She's dia Ste. She is from the還زа. No point in telling her that. She knows, and I do believe in her from the outside, From the Bella Pat It seems to scope it out. I can see it. There's sister on the stairs. Well, the 4th of July is over. The people are gone and lying the entire house. John thought he might do it, but it's a little company. So he just had mother and son and children lying for the night. Of course, I have been in the corner of the gym this whole time. But at the time, John said that he was afraid to go to the gym. He was just afraid to wear a uniform and follow me. I had a friend who was with us come in, John. And she says he was just like John and my brother. Only more or less. He says he has such an image of what he's called. I don't feel as if it was worth it. I turn my hand over from anything. I'm getting a grip from the front of the car. I have not seen the car this time. Of course, I don't see John. Nobody else. I don't know if I've ever seen him. I don't know if I've ever seen him. John is talking to me very often to see his kids. And John is good. He lets me know when I'm about to go. So I walk in a little new car. I'm in a little new car. I sit on the porch and move the wheels. I sit on my own car. I'm in a little new car. I'm in spite of that. I'm not supposed to drive it. As well as in my mind so. I'm in a very unmovable car. I'm in a little car. And follow that pattern that I've got to follow. It is as good as gymnastics, I assure you. I start, I'll say, at the bottom. Down in the corner over there where it has not been touched. And I determine for the thousandth time that I will follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a conclusion. I know a little of the principle of design. And I know this thing is not arranged on any laws of radiation or alternation or repetition or symmetry or anything else that I've ever heard of. It is repeated, of course, by the breads, but not other breads. Looked at in one way, each bret stands alone. The bloated curves and flourishes. A kind of debased Romanesque with delirium trimmings go waddling up and down in isolated columns of fertility. But on the other hand, they connect diagonally. And the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror, like a lot of wallowing seaweeds in full chase. The whole thing goes horizontally too. At least it seems so. I exhaust myself and try to distinguish the order that's going in that direction. They've used a horizontal breadth for a freeze. And that adds wonderfully to the confusion. There is one end of the room where it is almost intact. And there, when the crosslights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it, I can almost fancy radiation after all. The interminable grotesques seem to form around the common center and rush off in a headlong plunge of people's destruction. It makes no time to follow it. I will take a nap, I guess. I don't know why I should write this. I don't want to. I don't feel able. And I know, John, that they could have served. But I must say what I feel and think in some way it is such a relief. And it never seems to be greater than half the time that I am offered a ride down ever so much. John says I mustn't lose my strength. And he has me take cod liver oil and lots of tonics and things to say nothing of ale and wine in rare meat. Dear John, he loves me dearly and hates to have me sick. I tried to have a real earnest reason to talk with him the other day and tell him how I wish he would let me go and make a visit to cousin Henry and Julia. But he said I wasn't able to go, nor able to stand it after I got there. And I did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was crying before I had finished. It is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight. Just this nervous weakness, I suppose. And dear John gathered me up in his arms and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed and sat by me and read to me until it tired my head. He said I wish his darling and his comfort in all he had and that I must take care of myself for his sake and keep well. He says no one but myself can help me out of it. That I must use my will and self-control and not let any silly fancies run away with me. There's one comfort. The baby is well and happy and does not have to occupy this nursery with a horrid wallpaper. If we had not used it, the blessed child would have. What a fortune and escape. Why, I wouldn't have a child of mine, an impressionable little thing, living such a room for worlds. I never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John kept me here after all. I can stand it so much easier than a baby, you see. Of course, I never mention it to anyone, I am too wise, but I keep watching what I ever say. There are things in that paper that nobody knows but me or ever will. Behind that outside pattern, the dim shapes get clearer every day. It's always the same shape, only very new. Then it is likely one of you sticking down and cranking about behind that pattern. I don't like it a bit, I wonder how they're going to think. I wish John would take me away from here. It's so hard to talk to John about my case, because he was so wise and because he loves me so. But I tried it last night. It was moonlight. The moon shines in all around just as the sun does. I hate to see it sometimes, it feels so slow. It always comes in about one window and another one. John was asleep and I hid it to wake him up. So I kept still and watched the moonlight and that insulating wall of people till I felt the people. The fate for you behind it seemed to shape the pattern. Just as if she wanted to pass. I got up softly and looked at you. You see, the paper didn't move. And when I came back, John was awake. What is it little girl? He said. Don't go walking about like that. You'll get cold. I thought it was a good time to talk. So I told him that I really was not gaining in the wish he would take me away. Why darling, our lease will be up in three weeks and I can't see how to leave before. The repairs are not done at home and I cannot possibly leave town just now. Of course, if you were in any danger, I could and would. But you really are a better deer. Whether you can see it or not. I am a doctor deer and I know that you are gaining flesh and color. Your appetite is better. I thought it was much easier about you. I don't wear a bit more, said I. Nor as much. And my appetite may be better in the evening when you are here, but it is worse in the morning when you are away. Bless her little heart, said he with a great big hug. She shall be as sick as she pleases. But now, let's improve the shining hours by going to sleep and talk about it in the morning. And you won't go away? I ask, why? How can I, dear? It is only three weeks more and then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while Ginny is getting the house ready. Really, dear, you are better. Better in body, perhaps, I began, and stopped short, for he sat up straight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I could not say another word. My darling, said he, I beg of you for my sake and for our child's sake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant let that idea into your mind. There is nothing so dangerous, so fascinating to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish fancy. Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so? So, of course, I said no more on that score and we went to sleep before the night. He thought I was asleep first, but I wasn't. And lay there for hours trying to decide whether that front pattern and that back pattern really did move together or separately. On a pattern like this, like daylight, there is a lack of sequence, a defiance of law, that is a constant irritant to a normal mind, where color is hideous enough and unreliable enough and infuriating enough with the patterns torturing. You think you have mastered it, but just as soon as you get well underway in following, it turns up back somersault and there you are. It slaps you in the face, knocks you down, and tramples upon you. This is like a bad dream. The outside pattern is a florid arabesque, reminding one of a funless. If you can imagine a toadstool in joints, an interminable stream of toadstools, budding, and scouting in endless convolutions, why, that is something like it. That is, sometimes, there is one mark of a familiar and out-of-the-south, but there are no others who are similar to this. And that is what changes as the art changes. When the sun shoots in for a first window, I always watch that first long, straight rain. It changes so quickly that I never can quite believe it. That is why I watch it all in this. By moonlight, the moon shines in all night when there is a moon. I wouldn't know it was the same paper. At night, in any kind of light, in twilight, candlelight, lamp light, and worst of all, by moonlight, it becomes bars of the outside pattern I'm in, and the woman behind it has as plain as can be. I didn't realize for a long time what the thing was that showed behind that dim sub-pattern, but now I am quite sure it is a woman. By daylight, she has subdued quiet. I fancy that it's the pattern that keeps her so still. It is so pleasant, it keeps me quiet by the hour. I lie down ever so much, and John says it is good for me, and to sleep all I can. He started to have it by making me lie down for an hour to each man. It is a very bad habit I am convinced, for you see I don't sleep, and that cultivates deceit, for I don't tell them I'm awake, oh no. The fact is, I'm getting a little afraid of John. He seems very queer sometimes, and even Ginny has an inexplicable look. It strikes me occasionally, just as a scientific hypothesis, that perhaps it is the paper. I have watched John when he did not know I was looking, and come into the room suddenly on the most innocent excuses, and I've caught him several times looking at the paper. And Ginny too, I caught Ginny with her hand on it once. She didn't know I was in the room. And then I asked her, she was doing the paper. She turned around as if she had been caught stealing, and looked quite angry, asking me why I should frighten her so. Then she said, if the paper stained everything it touched, she had found yellow speaches on all my clothes and jobs. And she wished for me to be more careful, with my actions. And she said, I was in John's, and she wished for me to be more careful, with my acts as an innocent. But I know she was studying that pattern, and I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself. Life is so very much more exciting now than it used to be. You see, I have something more to expect, to look forward to, to watch. I will do better, and I'm more quiet than I was. John is so pleased to see me agree. He laughed a little the other day. He said I seemed very close, and he spied up my wallpaper. I turned off the wallpaper. I have no intention of telling him, it was because of the wallpaper. He would make fun of me. He might even want to take me away. I don't want to leave now until I have found it out. There is a week more, and I think that would be enough. I'm feeling ever so much better, I don't see much at night, where it is so interesting to watch developments. But I see the good deal in the daytime, and the daytime is just tiresome and full-fledged. There are always new sheets on the fungus, and new shades of yellow all the months. I cannot keep count of it. I try to be conscientious, but it is a stranger to know about all of it. It makes me think of all the yellow things I ever saw. The non-beautiful ones are the other things. The old, the bad, the bad, the bad ones. There's something else about me. The smell. I noticed that the moment it came into the room, there was so much air and sun that it was not bright. Now we have had a week of bothering me, and whether the windows are open or not, the smell is still here. I find it troubling in the dining room, sculpting in the corridor, hiding in the hall, crying and waiting on the stairs. It gets in and out of here. Even when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise it, there is that smell. Such a peculiar odor too. I have spent hours in trying to analyze it to find what it smelled like. It is not bad at first, and very gentle, to quite the subtlest, most enduring odor I've ever met. And this damp weather is awful. I wake up in the night and find it moving over me. I'm used to disturbing at first. I thought seriously burning the house to reach the smell. But now I'm used to it. The only thing I can think of is that it is like the color of the paper. A yellow smell. There's a very plain mark on this one. I go around, I go around, I go straight down the round road. It goes behind every piece of furniture. It's up to there. Long, straight, even smooch. As if it had been rubbed, way, way before. I wonder how it was done, if it did it. And what they did it for. Round and round and round, round and round and round, it makes me dizzy. I really have discovered something about this. Through watching so much at night, when it changes so. I finally found it out. The foot pattern does move. And no wonder, the woman behind shakes it. Sometimes I think there are great many women behind. And sometimes only one. But she calls around fast. And her phone shakes it all over. Then in very bright spots, she just takes hold of the bars. And shakes them hard. And she's all the time trying to turn through. But nobody can climb through that pattern. And stream this out. I think that is why it has so many heads. They get through. And then the pattern strangles them all. And turns them upside down. And makes their eyes pop out. Those heads are covered. They're taken off. They're not like lost in the world. I think that woman gets out of the data. And I tell you what. I've seen her. I can see her at every one of the windows. It is the same woman I know. For she is always creeping. And most women do not creep by daylight. I see her on that long road under the trees. Creeping along. And when a carriage comes, she hides under the Blackberry Vines. I don't blame her a bit. It must be very humiliating to be caught creeping by daylight. I'm always locked the door when I creep by daylight. I can't do it at night. For I know John would suspect something at once. And John is so queer now. That I don't want to irritate him. I wish he would take another woman. But I don't want anybody to get that woman. I don't want anybody to get that woman. I don't want anybody to get that woman. I don't want anybody to get that woman. I turn as fast as I can. I can only see at every one of the times. I'm not a far away seeker. She may be able to creep faster than I can turn. I have watched her sometimes away off in the open country. Creeping as fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind. I've only that top pattern could have gotten off from the under. I mean to try it little by little. I have found out another funny thing. But I shan't tell it at this time. It does not do the trust people too much. There are only two more ways to get this people off of you. And I believe John is beginning to believe you. I don't want you looking at me. And I've heard him this day. A lot of professional questions about me. She had a very good report to give. She said I snuck the beautiful woman. John Hilt, I see her as a woman. You all are so quiet. He asked me all sorts of questions too. I pretend that I'm very loving and kind. As if I couldn't see through him. Still, don't wonder he acts so. Sleeping under this paper for three months. It only interests me. But I feel sure John and Jim are secretly affected by it. Hurrah! This is the last day. But it is enough. John is to stay in town overnight. And won't be out until this evening. Jimmy wanted to sleep with me. This little thing. But I told her I should undoubtedly rest better for a night all alone. That was clever. But I really wasn't alone a bit. As soon as it was moonlight. And that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern. I got up and ran to help her. I pulled and she shook. I shook and she pulled. And before morning we had peeled off yards of the paper. A strip about as high as my head. And half around the room. And then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me. I declared I would finish it today. We go away tomorrow. And they're all moving all my furniture down. And do many things as they were before. Jimmy looked at the wall in amazement. But I told her merrily that I did it at a pure spite at the vicious thing. She laughed and said she wouldn't mind doing it herself. But I must not get tired. How she betrayed herself that time. But I am here. And no person touches this paper but me. Not alive. She tried to get me out of the room. That was too bad. But I said it was so quiet and empty and clean. Now that I believed I would lie down again and sleep all I could. And not to wake me, even for dinner. I would call when I woke up. So now she is gone. And the servants are gone. And the things are gone. And there is nothing left that great bedstead nailed down into the canvas mattress we found on this paper. We shall sleep downstairs tonight. And take the boat home tomorrow. I quite enjoyed the room. How those children did tear about here. This bedstead is fairly gnawed. But I am a skip to work. I have locked the door and thrown the key down into the compact. I don't want to go out. And I don't want to have anybody come in until John comes. I want to go astonished. I've got a rope here that even Ginny did not find. If that woman does get out and tries to get away, I can tie her. But I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on. This bed will not move. I tried to lift and push it until I was lame. And then I got so angry I bit off a little piece in one corner. But it hurt my teeth. Then I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor. It sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it. All those strangled heads and bulbous eyes and waddling feet. Those strangled heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with derision. I'm getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the window with the admirable exercise, the bars are too strong even to try. Besides, I wouldn't do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step like that is improper and might be misconstrued. I don't like to even look out of the windows. There are so many of those creeping women and they creep so fast. I wonder if they all came out of that wallpaper as I did. But I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope. You don't get me out in the road there. I suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes night and that is hard. It is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I please. I don't want to go outside. I won't even if Jenny asked me to. For outside you have to creep on the ground and everything is green instead of yellow. But here I can creep smoothly on the floor and my shoulder just fits into that long smootch around the wall. So I cannot lose my way. Why? There's John at the door. It's no you, young man. You can't open it. How he does call and pound. Now he's crying for an axe. It would be a shame to break down that beautiful door. John, dear, said I in the gentlest voice. The key is down by the front steps under a plantain leaf. That silence told him for a few moments. Then he said, very quietly indeed, Open the door, my darling. I can't, said I. The key is down by the front door under a plantain leaf. And then I said it again several times, very gently and slowly, and said it so often that he had to go and see. And he got it of course and came in. He stopped short by the door. What is the matter? he cried. For God's sake, what are you doing? I kept on creeping just the same. But I looked at him over my shoulder. I've got out at last, said I, in spite of you and Ginny. And I've pulled off most of the paper. So you can't put me back. Now why should the man have fainted? But he did, and ran across my path by the wall. So that I had to creep over him every time. End of The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilliman.
