 This is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of and pull that. That's why I ought to hit him like so cheaply. And why the streets are long and tangled, which aren't lasting for me, but one expects that in marriage. John is practical in his dream. He has no patience with faith. And since horror superstition, and he's got openly at any top of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures. John is a physician and perhaps, I would not say to a living soul of course, this is dead paper and I'd like to live to my mind. Perhaps, that there's one reason I did not get well faster. And you see, he does not believe I am sick. And what can I know? The physician and my son, he has grown blood, and he has been a human, but she has been a mother. And he knows it. He's very nothing in that of it, and he's a simple learning, and he has this profession. It's like a story of a teenager. What is going to be? My brother is also a physician. I'm also a high student. And he says the same thing. He's a very fast-paced, sort of fast-bodied, for whichever he is. And Thomas, and Jenny needs an A&E exercise, and he absolutely needs for getting it to work until I'm well-dressed. Personally, I disagree with the idea. Personally, I believe the continued, but excitedly changed, and I do need you. What is one to do? I did write for a while in spite of it. But it does, you trust me. I believe this is a slide. It helps me to recover my life. I sometimes fancy, but my condition, if I had less opposition and more society and stimulus, the John says the very worst thing I can do is think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad. So I will let it alone and talk about the house. The most beautiful place, at his quite a loan, standing well back from the road, quite three miles from the village, and makes me think of English places that you read about. But there are hedges and walls and dikes that walk, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people. There's a delicious garden, and never saw such a gardener, large and shady, full of boxboarded paths, and lime with long, lit, covered artways with seats under them. There are greenhouses too, but they're all broken now. There was some legal trouble, something about the house and the car owners. But I didn't even know the place that I couldn't hear is. That spoils my door selling this sign for me. But I don't care. There's something strange about this. I can hear it. I even said so to John, and he said, but I don't know the drama. He was shocked. But he came in and he was in the drama side. I'm sure I never used to do this since then. I think it is due to his nervous condition. But John says, if I feel so, I should neglect proper self control, so I take things to control this. Before him, he said, and that makes me curious. I don't know why I thought he knew it. I want to know what he's saying, because he's looking on the ground. And how good is this? All over the window. Such good is all the fashion and the shirts coming. John's back to the office. He said, I don't know. I'm not going to do it. I just don't see it. I know you're going through film. To another. He's very, very young. He's having that same stroke, that special direction. And the signature to describe the image of his father. He takes all of care for me. He said, I feel pretty, I don't know how to describe it. He said, if you're so young, if I was to have a perfect list, and all the air I could get. Your exercise depends on your strength, my fear, setting, and your food, somewhat on your appetizer. But ever you can absorb all the time. So he took the nursery at the top of the house. It is a big airing, the whole floor in the air. With windows that look all the way, and air and sunshine glow. It was nursery first, and then play room and imagination, as you judge. But the windows are violent, and what children. And there are means, things along the snow. The people, people look as if a boy's school had used it. It is stripped off the paper. In great patches, all around the head of my bed, about as far as I can. I never saw a little girl, and I was just flying, flame, burning, and eating every artistic side. I have to constantly irritate and provoke study. And when you follow the main uncertain curves, all the distance, they suddenly commit suicide, plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves, and then herd of contradictions. The colour is repellent, all those who go to a small room, unchimmable, a small mungy baby, by the slag, a small sandwich. I don't know, the old, the old, the old, some places, sickly, self-retent knows. No wonder the children hated it, I should hate it myself, I had to live in this room long, there comes joy. Unless I think this is a living room, I would write a word. If then you turn over the wall, and let him go, write it. What's inside, what's inside, do you sit in the Bible window? Up in this heteroscious emotion, there's nothing in your mind, as much as I can, so black, stroke, John is away, all the, leaving some nights when he's facing the serious, and where my case is my choice. He's nervous towards the wall, to let me confess to him. John does not know how much I really suffered. He knows there is no reason to suffer. But not satisfied, how, of course, it was only another thing. It does weigh on me so not to do my duty in any way. I meant to be such a hope to John, such a real rest and comfort, but here I am, a comparative burden already. No one would believe what an end of the world is. You would be able to live in the pool, and trust, and entertain. Another thing, it is fortunate, very, very good to be, such a dearer thing. And yet I cannot see this thing. It makes me so nervous. I suppose John is never in my business, he left me so, like I've just walked out of it. I first came into the hope of him, but afterwards he said, I was letting it get the better of him, and that nothing in his life, and he was looking for a more despicable person, and he didn't give away such choices. They said, after the law of being a stranger, he didn't give him a kiss, and then he found when he left me. And then he gave up, but never for scary ones. He said, you know the place is doing your good, and really do it. I don't care to renovate the house, just for a three-one swimmer. He didn't do that as he was going down. He said, he was like, I'm going to search for John and he's like, When he took me, he was like I told him, he was like, he said, you really don't? The same. You know, someone has a crush on him. Like, I think he is like me. I think he is like me. And he's like me. He's like a cat. He's like me. He's like me. He's like me. And he's like me. I'm not going to see that, he's like me. Just like that. I'm not sure if I can get it back to home. I'm not sure if I can get it back to home. I'm not sure if I can get it back to home. I'm not sure if I can get it back to home. I'm not sure if I can get it back to home. I'm not sure if I can get it back to home. I'm not sure if I can get it back to home. I'm not sure if I can get it back to home. I'm not sure if I can get it back to home. I'm not sure if I can get it back to home. I'm not sure if I can get it back to home. I'm not sure if I can get it back to home. I'm not sure if I can get it. I'm not sure if I can get it back at home. I'm not sure. Don't worry, because I know money is on my way home. We're not sure if we can have a tornado. I'm not sure if I can get it back to home. I'm not sure if we can get it back to home. I think sometimes I would call you when you're like, but you really have the first idea to do this. But I found it like a pretty time. And it's so just filled. I'm not gonna let you go. I'm gonna use a car to do that. Can I get really well? But John's actually has a pleasant feeling. And he's going to go on visit. He says he really suits the pilot. He's not a pilot. He's like, hey, that's the lucky thing. He has very stimulating people out here. He's like, what's that? I'm sorry, but I must not think about that. So this kicker next to me is a bit new for the British experience. There's a recurrence spot in it. I'm talking about how to use a broken metal. But I think the British are just so close to me. I get causatively angry when I put my toes and ever last use. Up and down inside it's the tall. And those are just so amazing how I set it everywhere. There's one little place for two breaths in the night. And the eyes go all up and down in the light. And then the little guy on the knee cover. You're just so small, just especially in the middle of the world. And we all know how much especially we have. We're just flying great to each other. And you know how to do it. Just help. And maybe that's not a good thing. And then there's a joke. And you're just like, I remember how many of you are. You know how much about good old people in the state. And you've got to know each other. All this stuff. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. And you have a whole bunch of little people. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. The Frenchman is just so nice and more worse than you can be. But we had to bring all of our opinions to all of this. But I said, Why is it close? When this was used as a carer, when we had to take a more sweet things out. And no wonder. And there were so such ravages of the children's opinion here. The wall here, which I said, is torn off in silence. And it's sticking close, right? But we must have a good experience. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. There comes John's sister, Such a derby choice. And so cute. It's cool. I'm going to buy one. This is a perfect place to go. It's cool. It's cool. It's cool. It can only be the right choice. It's interesting. It's nice. It's very nice. It shows the light. It shows the light. There is one. I love this shit. Just shut up. You can't get close. There is one. I'm gonna take a little here too. Just shut up. There is one. Just shut up. There is one. It seems to have stopped. There is this one. Well, the fourth of July is over. The people are gone. They are tired. They are gone. They are gone. So we just have nothing. We are shooting. There is. There is. There is. There is. There is. There is. There is. There are fans to discuss about tonight. The message is, just like John Ngod expels. Only Warsaw. Something like that? the first one is the front the first one is the front the front is the front the front is the front the front is the front the front is the front the front is ya snow chattering which detects the promise hard but is as good as gymnastics of the show I start, and I say, at the bottom, down in the corner over there where it has not been touched. And I determine for the thousandth time that I will follow that rules, have them to some sort of conclusion. I know a little of a principle of design, and I know this thing is not arranged on the new laws of radiation, or all-termation, or repetition, or so much as anything else that I've ever heard. It doesn't seem to be a good idea, but that's not a good idea. Looked at in one way, each breath stands away, the bloated curves and fourishes. I kind of debase Romanesque with delirium trimmings, go wobbling up and down and isolated columns of fertility. But on the other hand, they connect diagonally, and the sprawling outlines run off in great, slanting waves up to coral, like a lot of wallowing seaweed and full chase. The whole thing goes horizontally too, at least at same side. That exhaust lights up in the trimmings, the order of its goal and direction. They have used a horizontal breath for a freeze, and that adds one-reflated confusion. There is one end of the room where it is almost intact, and there, when the cross-light's fade, and the low sun shines directly at the planet, I can almost fancy radiation after all. The intonable grid tests seem to fall around the common scene, and rush off in heavy-longing and the light is in the sky. It makes it much harder to follow it. How will I take it now, by this? I don't know why I should write this, I don't want to. I don't feel able, and I know John would think that I'm so old, but I'm must. Say what I feel, I think he's so mad, it is such a relief. He's having a really good day, and he's having a really good day. And after the time I'm happy with him, and I don't ever see much. John says I must have been his master. And he is going to take a quad liver hole, and lots of stomachs and things, to say nothing, ailing wine, and a little needs. Dear John, he loves him and a deal, and hates to have himself. I tried to have a real earnest, easy way to talk with him at the day, and tell him why I wish you would let me go and make a visit to cousin Henry and Julia. But he said, I wasn't able to go. Nor able to stand it after I got there, and I did not make out a very good case for myself. When I was crying before I had finished, it is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight. Just this nervous weakness I suppose. And dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me until it tired my head. He said, I was his darling, I was comforted, and all of you had. And that I must take care of myself for his sake, and keep well. He says no one but myself can help me out of it. But I'm asking you, am I real and self-control, and not let any silly fence he's run away with me. There's one comfort. The baby is well and happy, and does not have to occupy this immersive, with a hearted wall of paper. If we had not used it, the blessed child would have, what a fortune in a scape. Why? I wouldn't have a child of mine, an impressionable little thing, live in such a room for worlds. I never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John kept me here after all. I can stand so much easier than a baby, you see. Of course, I never mentioned it to a new woman, I need to rise. But I keep watching her, I never say. There are things in that paper, and you know that we know each other's from me, and I have a world. Behind that outside pattern, the gym shapes get clearer every day. It's always the same shape, only very new. You just look at the woman, she's been down and clicking about her own pattern. I don't like it with this, I wonder at the end of the thing. I wish John would take me away from here, and it's so hard to talk to John about my taste, because he was so wise, because he wasn't so, but I tried to listen to him. He was new in my life. The new inions and all around, just he was new in the sea. I hate to see if he finds me. I hate to see all his eyes. All his clothes in my woman, I don't know what I'm going to do. John was asleep, and I headed to waiting. So I kept staring and watching the new woman, and I ended you waiting all the time. I thought he would. He's 8, 4, 5 years old, and he's seen the shape of her. Just his posture on his eyes. I got up soft, he was looking at me. I could didn't. And when I came back, John was awake. What is it, little girl, he said, Don't go walking about like that. You get cold. I thought it was a good time at all. So I told him that you were not getting away. And that I wish to take me away. Why darling, so, I at least will be up in three weeks, and I can't see how to be before. There are pairs of not done in home. And I cannot possibly tell this now. Of course, if you were in any danger, I could and would, But you really are better here. Whether you can see the knot. I'm a doctor here. I know you're gaining flesh and color. The appetite is better. I thought it really was easy about you. I thought to wear a bit more, said I. More is much. Am I appetite maybe better in the evening when you are here? But it is worse in the morning when you are awake. Bless her, little heart, said to you, the great good girl. She shall be a sick as she pleases. But now, let's include the shining hours by going to sleep. I'll talk about it in the morning. And you won't go away. I just want to know why. How can I, dear? It is only three weeks more. And then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while Jimmy is getting the house ready. Really, dear. You are better. Better in body perhaps. I have it in the start of the day. For a set up straight and looked at me with such a stern, Reputual look that I could not say another word. My darling said, who? I'd beg of you. For my sake and for our child's sake. As well as for our own. But you will never put one instant Let that idea into your mind. There is nothing so dangerous. So fascinating to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish fancy. Can you not trust me as a physician who I tell you so? Of course I said no more on this far. And we went to sleep for a long time. I thought I would sleep for a long time. I thought I would sleep first. And I wasn't. And later for hours trying to decide what would that Fun pattern and that pattern really did move together for separate. On a pattern like this, like they were right. There is a lack of secrets. At the finds of law. There is a constant irritant to a normal mind. The color is hideous enough. And unreliable enough. And infuriating enough. Put the patterns to fortune. Thank you for the master's. But just as soon as you get well underway and following, It turns up back to summer salt and there you are. It slaps you in the face. Knocks you down and truncles the funny. Just like a bad dream. The outside patterns are flawed or a bus. Reminding one of the funnest. If you can imagine a toast to a joint. An internal astringue toast to a joint. But in this pattern in these conditions. Why? That is something like it. There is some diamonds. There is one in the market. There is one in the market. There is one in the market. There is one in the market. There is a change in the sense of what changes. In the sense you are saying that you are screaming. I always watch it. I first saw it and straightened it. It changes so quickly that I knew I can quite believe it. That is why I watched it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. It becomes bars. The outside pattern. In the woman behind it. This is plain as convenient. But I didn't realize for a long time. The thing was that I showed behind it. That damn sub pattern. But now I am quite sure it is a woman. But I do not know what she is doing. Quite. I found something. She is a power in the future. She is so pleasant. She is weak while I am running out. I like that. I am never so much. The giant treasure is different. I am just seeing all that came. But he started to have it. I am making me lie down. I am not sure what to know. It is a very bad habit I have been raised. For you see, I do not see. And that cultivates the seat. If I do not tell them I am awake. Oh no. The fact is, I am getting a little afraid of John. He seems very clear sometimes. And even Jenny has an inexplicable look. It strikes me occasionally. Just as a scientific hypothesis. It perhaps it is the paper. I have watched John and he did not know I was working. And coming to the room suddenly on the most innocent excuses. And I have caught him several times. Looking at the paper in 22. I caught Jenny with her hand on it once. She did not know I was in the room. I know I was trying to find out. I am not sure. I am not sure. I am not sure. I am not sure. I am not sure. It tries toчно around. I have been caught here. I am not quite angry. Actually, I have never seen this new type of surgeon happening. It is passion,我覺得 is beautiful which is why they are beautiful. Not always more things than it is. I know that I am still studying here. And I am determined that nobody should have find out of itself. Life is so very much more exciting than I did.... So very much more exciting than it used to be, you see, I got something more to expect, to get bored to watch. I really don't know about it, and I'm more quiet than it was. John is so pleased to see you here. He won't know the other thing. He said I seen him get bored, he needs to hide in my wallet. I don't know about that. I have no intention to hide in his pocket. He was quite a close, but he was not quite able to. He might even want to take me away. I don't want to leave now until I found him out. There is a week more, and I think that would be enough. I'm feeling ever so much better. If I don't see much of a night, but he's so interesting to watch the movies. But I see the good thing, I don't know what to call it. And there's how many stars in the box. There are always new shapes on the funnest. And new shapes are yellow, all the lights. I can't lie to you, John. There are a lot of things you just bought. But there is a strange moment where I can't understand. And it's gonna take a cold, yellow thing in the box. And I feel the wind is blowing. And there's something else about it. It's snow. The snow is the kind of moon that came into the moon. There's so much snow on the side of the earth. And now it's about the moon. And while the moon is open, it's about the night. It's so scary. It's just a little scary. If I need to cover the moon, it's not even a little dark. It's still a little hard. If I need to cover the moon, it's not a little dark. If I need to cover the moon, it's not a little dark. Even when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly into prizes, there is that smell. Such a peculiar odor too. I have spent hours in trying to analyze it. To find what it's smell. It is not bad. It's first. And very gentle. It's quite the sun-est. The most thing during the ride ever met. And this damp weather was awful. I wake up in the night and find it here over. It used to disturb me first. I thought seriously, I wanted to have a swim. To reach the snow. But now I'm used to it. It's only thing I can think of because it is like the colour of the paper. A yellow smell. It's very clean. It's pretty clean. It goes completely. It's a little dirty. It's a little dirty. It's a little dirty. It's a little dirty. I wonder how it's done. It's a little dirty. Round and round and round. Round and round and round. It makes me dizzy. I really have discovered something about life. He watches so much at night. He changes. He finally found it out. The foot haven't done his new. And no wonder the woman behind shakes it. Sometimes people are really moaning. Sometimes I'm going to run. He just calls her no fives. And her phone shakes it all over. He's getting very nice. He's so much more stressed. He's getting very shamed. She just takes it all to the bars and shakes them hard. He can't see all the time. But nobody can do that, Kevin. He's doing this. He's got so many heads. They get through. And then the pattern, the strain goes along. It turns them upside down. And makes it worse. He's probably taking it off. I think that woman did tell him the data. Not telling you what. I've seen it. I've seen it. Every woman who went out. She's the same woman. And for she is always creeping. And most women do not creep by daylight. I see her on the wrong road under the trees. Creeping along. And when a carriage comes, she hides under the blackberry vines. I don't blame her a bit. It must be very humiliating. I can't creep in my daylight. I know it's awkward or I might have had daylight. I can't do it at night. For I know John is suspect something was. John is so clear now. But I don't want to irritate him. I wish you would take me out of here. No, I'm not. I don't know if I would get that woman out of here. I don't want you to see me. I don't want you to see me. It's crazy. This is I can't. I can't see you. It's awkward. She may be able to creep faster than I can turn. I can watch her sometimes. I'm often in open country. Creeping is nasty. I'll shadow in my high window. I'm going to the clock tower. You got me all free in there. I need to try it. We'll go by a little bit. I found out another funny thing. But I shall tell her this time. It's not even a trust pick to me. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. I'm going to try it. There's a hole in the�. There's a hole in the�. That's gonna touch this hole. There's no hole in the�. It just fale. It's methods for 小 necessities. This is the last game. But it is enough. John is to stay in town overnight and will be out until this evening. Jamie wanted to stay with me. But I told her I should undoubtedly less better for a night. That was clever. But I really wasn't alone a bit. As soon as it was moonlight and that four thing began to call and shake the pattern, I got up and ran to help her. I pulled and she shook. I shook and she pulled. And before morning we had peeled off yards of the paper. A strip about as high as my head and half around the room. And then when the sun came and the off of pattern began to laugh at me, I declared I would finish it today. We go away tomorrow and they're all moving all my furniture down. I'm dying things as they were before. Jamie looked at the wall in the maze. But I told her, He got to get a pure spite of the vicious thing. She laughed and said she wouldn't mind doing it herself. But I must not get tired. How she betrayed herself that time. But I am here and no person touches this paper but me. Not alive. She tried to get me out of the room. But I said it was so quiet. I was thinking, I love to leave that little lie down again. She didn't call like her. I'm not to wake me even for dinner. I would call her when I was. So now she is gone. And the servants are gone. And the things are gone. And there's nothing left that great dead skin. And they all died. And there's nothing left that I don't know. Jesus, don't say anything. It's a good book for me to know. Why you enjoyed it? There are. How those children did tear about here. This bed still is fairly odd. But I am just going to work. I have lost a little bit and thrown it through. I need to go from home. I don't want to go out. And I don't want to have anybody come in. So John becomes. I want to go stonish. I've got a rope here. I'm sure you've been Ginny did not find. If that woman does get out and tries to get away, I can tie her. But I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on. This bed will not move. I tried to lift and push it until I was laying. And then I got so angry. I bit off a little piece at one corner. But it hurt my teeth. Then I peel off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor. It sticks horribly. And the pattern just enjoys it. All those strangled heads and pulled this eyes and wobbling fungus gross. Just shriek with derision. I'm getting angry and up to do something desperate. To jump out the window with the admirable exercise. The barge is too strong even to try. Besides, I wouldn't do it. Of course not. I know well enough that the step like that is in favor of my name is in screw. I don't like to even look out of the windows. There are so many of those creeping women. They creep so fast. I wonder if they all came out of that wallpaper as I do. But I am securely fastened now by my well-pidden rope. You don't get me out of the room there. That's a close. I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes night. And that is hard. It is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I please. I don't want to go outside. I want even if it doesn't pass me too. And outside you have to creep on the ground and everything is green instead of yellow. But here I can creep smoothly on the floor. And my shoulder just fits into that long smoothing around the wall. So I cannot lose my way. Why? There is John at the door. It is no usual man. You can't open it. How he does call and filmed. Now he is crying for an axe. It would be a shame to break down that beautiful door. John dear. Said I in the ginnless voice. The key is down by the front steps. Under a plantain leaf. That sounds tone for a few moments. He said very quietly and deep. Open the door. My darling. I can't say I. The key is down by the front door. Under a plantain leaf. And then I said it again. Several times. Very gently and slowly. And said it so often that he had to go and see. And he got it of course and came in. And he stopped short by the door. What is the matter he cried? For God's sake, what are you doing? I kept on creeping just the same. But I looked at him over my shoulder. I have got out at last. Said I. In spite of you and Jenny. And I've pulled off most of the paper. So you can't put me back. Now why should the man have fainted? What he did. And ran across my path by the wall. So that I had to creep over him every time.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
