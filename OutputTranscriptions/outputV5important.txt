 This is a readable recording. I read the watch recording on the internet. The more information that you want to hear is visited www.daptoreal.com. I love you. I love you. Let me tell you that you must be this, such a true, leadership and definitely, a very valuable, my Charlotte, Puppies, girl. It is very seldom in your ordinary people I join myself securing such profiles for the same. A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate. I would say a haunted house, and rich the fight of romantic philosophy, but that would be asking too much of fate. Still, I would proudly declare that there is something pure about it. But why else could it be less so cheaply, and why that stays a long untimely? John laughs at me in the face. But no one expects that in my area. John is practical to me, extreme. He has no patience to think, and in fit thought, he is a possible, not to be thought and seen, and put down in figures. John is a tradition, and perhaps, I don't know if I'm living so well, but this is a great fit, and a great relief to my mind. Perhaps, that is one reason I do not live so well in that state. You see, he does not believe I am fit, and what commanding, but that the fit man can't stand, and knows only heaven, that there is thin and military, that there is really nothing to matter with me, but thinking of him in nervous depression, or slightly scared of intimacy, and what is wrong to me. My brother is also a proficient man, and also a kind man, and he is also a good man. So I take both faiths and false thoughts, whichever it is, and tonics, and journeys, and air, exercise, and absolutely forget them, and I take them all again. Personally, I disagree with your ideas. Personally, I believe that if you kneel, and if you sit and change, you do me good. But what is one to do? We've got faith in this matter, but it dies in self-sufficiency, if you're having to be so sly about it, or else you meet with heavy opposition. I sometimes stand to be in opposition, but if I have less opposition in the real society than the stimulus, what John says is the very worst thing I can do is think about my position, and I confess it always makes me feel bad. So I will let it alone and talk about the house. The most beautiful place that is quite alone, standing well back from the road, like three miles from the village, it makes me think of English placing on two new roads, where there are hedges and walls and gates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people. There's a delicious garden. I never saw such a garden, large and shady, full of box-boarded paths, and lined with long, great covered arches with silk tannins. There are greenhouses too, but they're all broken now. There was some legal trouble I could do, something about the poverty of food haters. Finally, the place has been empty for years. That spoils my merciless, I am afraid, but I don't care. There's something strange about the house. I can feel it. I mean, he said something, John. I mean, he said what I felt was abrupt and sharp-blown. I get then reasonably angry with John sometimes. I'm sure I've never used to be so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition. But John said if I feel so, I should regret the thought of self-preciel. So I take the urge to be sure of myself before him, and that makes me very proud. I don't like how you are. I want to go downstairs with the people I'm in contact with, and I know it's only in the room. In such pretty old fashion, it's hanging, but John will not hear it. He said there was only one room, and not one for two rooms, and no new room for him if he took another. He's very careful and loving, and finally, that's me still, not special than it can. I have a scheduled prescription for each morning, though. He takes all care of me, and so I feel basically ungrateful not to know you're there. He said we came here solely on my own, if I was to have perfect rest and all the air I could get. Your exercise depends on your strength, my dear, said he, and your food somewhat on your appetite. But you can absorb all the time. So we take the measure of the top of our heads. You didn't do anything. The whole floor, the windows of the building, and air and sunshine everywhere. And the main street, the main playground, is amazing. The windows are marked with the children, and there are wings and things in the wall. The main thing to take a look at is a good morning school. It was spittal, but the great catch was the morning when you hit the road. Now the stars are in the moon, and in a great place on the other side of the moon, and there was a song of worst people in the world, and a little song of grand-forbidden events that made him able to exist. It was a lonely and easy morning, and most of all, most of you feel the same, and the books tell you, and when you fall, you may be set in stone, and when you're in despair, you may be sent to make excuses. You don't even know where you've been, you spoil yourself and when you're in pain. You're falling in love, and when you're in pain, you may be set in stone, and when you're in pain, you may be set in stone. No, you will never be set in stone. Set in stone. No wonder the children are painted this way. I should paint it myself if I had to live in this rain alone. There comes John, I must put this away. He hates to have it left. We've been here two weeks, and I haven't felt like writing for him since that first day. I'm sitting in the barbell in the room, happiness is precious and merciless, and there's nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, said Blackstone. John is awake all day, and even some nights when his cases are serious, I'm glad my case is not serious. These nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing. John does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there's no reason to suffer, and I've saddened him. But the Lord says I'm in nervousness. There's a way on this earth, not that we might be in any way. I need to be such a help to God, such a real mess to the public, and here I am compared to the Lord in all ways. No one would believe what he ever did, but the little I made. Dress, and entertain, and other things. It is fortunate an area so good for the baby, such a dear baby, and yet I cannot speak with him. It makes me so nervous. I suppose John was never nervous in his life. He laughs at me so about this little paper. At first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I was letting it rip the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a nervous patient than to give way to such fancies. He said that after the wallpaper was changed, that it would be the heavy bedstead, and then the barred windows, and then the dated, and the heavy restaure, and so on. And he knows the place in which I'm here, and I really do. I don't care if I renovate and help, just for a three-month sliver. Then do let us go downstairs, I said. There are such pretty windows there. Then he took me in the morning to find me a blessed little room, and said he would go down to the ceiling, and have a white wash under the bottom. But here's what's enough about the bed, and when he was in pain. It is an air of uncomfortable room, and me wanting to use that hand for it. I would now be so silly to make him un-pumped just for a few minutes. I'm really getting quite the volume, while I'm having a little paper. I don't want anyone to know I can see that. There's mysterious deep-shaded air, and I just pour a passion for it. I wish there'd been more of my dreams. I don't know if I could help you, but I'd rather you'd be right at the door, belonging to the estate. There's a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking on these numerous paths, and others, but down there's nothing there not to be a word that depends on the least. He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making, a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manners of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency. So I try. I think sometimes, if I were only well enough to write for you, they would leave the press of ideas in lesson. But I find I get pretty tired when I'm trying. It is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my work. When I get really well, John says we'll have cousin Henry and Julia down for a long visit. But he says he would as soon as put fireworks in my Philippines, I still let me have those stimulating people about my arm. I wish I could get there fast. But I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as a bit needy with ambitious thinking. There's a dark spot for 20 years of a broken room, and two verbose arms stare to the outside of me. I get positively angry with the importance of it and everlastingness, up and down the sun-wrapped palm, and as it sears in the northern mountains of everywhere. And neither pretty nor plan certain length, nor sensual abandonment leans into Thine streets. No setting Maoke's perspiration on�� grows. We all know the much special energy in this world. The man who came in this era had a great balance between friends and most children from New Torre Sto. I remember the tiny week the mugs about eight other bureau staff and those mindshare only seemed like a spying friend. I used to feel that if any of the other friends were true friends, I could always talk to them about the children from DC. The furniture in this room is no worse than anything in this room, but you have to be all up to your own mistakes. I suppose to listen to the music of the program and take the music from this room, I know why, I never saw something like it in the children's room in here. The wall of the room is so small and small, it sticks it closer when running. It must have had a personal room to the lowest people. Then the floor is smashed and the ground is stung, and the rest of the cell is been up to the moon. This great hidden bed is a tiny tiny room, which is a little bit bigger than the room. Look at that little man in the room. Look at those glasses. Such a dear girl she is. He's so careful of her, and this not what I'm telling you. She's a perfect man, and he's a master of classical. He hopes for no better profession, but very blue, she thinks it was the lighting which made her sit. Look at that little man in the room. He's even long enough to move. There's one in the room. I love the shade of the moon. The moon just looks after me and everything. I love the country too. There's great mountains and other mountains. This wall of the program looks something like a chair. I particularly hate to know, but I think when you see it in certain rocks, you'll look good on the moon. Many places for a zippin, and only some just so. Let me see a screen which will open. Four more for me. It seems to be spoken of, and I'm going to see. I'm going to see if it opens up. There's this young stairs. Well, the Fourth of July is over. The people are gone and running and turning around. I don't know if I'm going to leave this room alone. There's this young man in the room, and I'm sure there's another one. I don't know if I'm going to leave. Jimmy says to me, you know, but it's time to go. John said, hello? I said, if I see you tomorrow, you're going to be gone. But I don't know if I'm going to leave. I don't know if I'm going to leave. And he says to me, just like John and my brother, don't leave me alone, so. It's such an empty room, and I don't know if I'm going to leave. Don't feel as if it was worth it. Turn my hand over from anything, and I'm getting dreadfully fretful and proud. I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. Of course, I don't feel honest here, or anybody else. I don't know if I'm going to leave. I don't know if I'm going to leave. I don't know if I'm going to leave. John's kept in town very often on serious cases, and Jimmy's heard that he's long enough to leave. So I walk over the room and I'm gone. I'm down at the lobby, and I sit on the porch, and I'm away. And I'm down at the lobby, and I'm going to leave. I'm really going to find a way to make this a good thing. I'm going to go to the pub. It dwells in my mind's soul. I lie here, and it's a great thing to move it again. It's a male thing. I've followed that time in that pub. I've been doing it for a good amount of time, and I'm doing it. I start to listen, but the bottom of the pub over there has not been touched. And I determine for the thousand times that I will follow that pointless pattern of some sort of a confusion. I know a little of the principle of design, and I know this thing was not arranged on any laws of radiation or alternation or repetition or symmetry or anything else that I'm not familiar with. I do that to do with the purpose. By the grace, but not other. Looked at in one way, each breath stands alone. The bloated curves and fourishes, a kind of debased braminette with delirium trimmings, they're wobbling up and down in isolated columns of fertility. But on the other hand, they can make the agri, and the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting waves up the corner, like a lot of wobbling sea waves with full taste. The full thing does the horizontal thing, at least it seems so. I exhaust myself in trying to continuously follow this boring imagination. They've eased the horizontal breath for a few seconds, and that adds wonderful confusion. There's one in the room where it's almost open, and there, when it costs like a spade, my little tongue shines directly at them. That's one of those things that I'm re-acting at, the incredible depth that's going to fill in around the coming season, and rush back to the terrible affinity that people have described. It makes no time to follow it. I will take a nap on this. I don't know why I should write this. I don't want to. I don't feel legal. I know, Johnny, that you're a conservative, and I'm not the same as what I feel and think that you suddenly prepare to such a relief. But the effort is going to be greater than your relief. Half the time I'm left with a relief, and lie down ever so much. Johnny says I mustn't lose my spirit, and he has me take too much of a role and lots of tonics and things, to say nothing, A-O and Y-O, and you will need. Dear John, he loves me dear, and hates to have me sick. I tried to have a real earnest reason to talk to him in the evening, and tell him that I wish he'd let me go and make a visit because the thing would be ruined. But he said I wasn't able to go. No, I was able to stand it after I got there, and I did not make out a very good case for myself, where I was crying before I finished. It is getting to be a great effort for me to finish this. This is never something I should lose. And dear John, gathers me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed. This sat on my head for the entire night. He said I was his darling, his comfort, and all he had, and that I must take care of myself for this, and keep well. He said he knew one but myself to help me out of it, that I must use my evil and self-control and not make deely silly fancies on a way of me. There's one topic, the baby is growing happy, and doesn't that have to occupy this nursery with a very good thing? If we had not used it, the blessed child would have. What a fortunate escape. Why, I wouldn't have a child of mine, and fresh in the little thing, would have been such a wonderful world. I never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John could leave me out to art. I can stand it so much easier than waiting, I swear. But of course I never mentioned it to anyone, I'm too honest, but I keep watching about all this, and you know, if things in that paper, then nobody knows who I am, or who I am. I'm an outside credit, and I do sheep with the deer every day. I always the same sheep, only very mean ones. And it is lucky in the only one sticking down and peaking about the honey that's patting. I don't like the bits, I wonder if they're going to paint. I wish John would take me away from here. It was so hard to talk with John about my case, but the case here is so wise, and the case he was in, so, but I tried to master it. It was new, young. The moon shines in all around the city sun. I can't see it sometimes, but it's still a little slow. And it always comes around me, but it's not a matter. John left the city, and I hid it to wait for him. So I kept stealing and watched him leave me, and I'd never be ready to wear a coat until I felt the pain. The fate figured my kind of scene to shake the pattern, and I just as wish he wanted to get out. I got up softly, and looked at the field, and see if the paper didn't leave me. And when I came back, John was awake. What is it, little girl? He said, don't feel walking about what that. You'll get pulled. I thought it was a good time to talk. So I told him that I really was not deeming him, and I wished he would take me away. Why, darling, said he, the police will be up in three weeks, and I can't see how to leave before. There are fears in my finished home, and I cannot possibly leave town just now. Of course, if you were in any danger, I could and would, but you really are a better deer, whether you can see it or not. I am a doctor, dear, and I know you're getting flesh and color. Your appetite is better, and I felt a little much easier about you. I don't wear a bit more, said I, nor as much, and my appetite may be better in the evening when you are here, but it is worse in the morning when you are away. The last whole little farm said he would be great, great fun. She shall be as super-sheep-free as it is. But now, let's improve the shining hours by going to sleep. Don't talk about it in the morning. And you won't go away? I ask, only. Why? How can I, dear? It is only three weeks more, and then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while Ginny is getting the house ready. Really, dear, you are better. Better in body, perhaps? I beg your pardon, I'll stop short, but very set up straight and looked at me with such a stern, refreshed look that I could not say another word. My darling, said he, I beg your neither for my sake and for our child's sake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant let that idea into your mind. There is nothing so dangerous, so fascinating to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish fantasy. Can you not trust me as a physician whom I tell you so? So, of course, I said no more, my score, and we went to sleep for four long. He thought I was asleep first, but I wasn't, and lay there for hours trying to decide whether that blood pattern and that intact pattern really did move together or separately. On a pattern like this, by daylight, there is a lack of sequence, a defiance of law, there is a constant irritant to a normal mind, but color is hideous enough and unreliable enough and infuriating enough that the pattern is torturing. You think you're mastered it, but just as soon as you get well under re-infulging, it turns a back somersault in there you are. It slaps you in the face, knocks you down, and cramples a plane. This is like a bad dream. The outside pattern is a fluid hervest, reminding one of a fungus. If you can imagine a toadstool in joints, an interminable string of toadstools, thudding, scouting, and endless convolutions, why, that is something like it. That is, sometimes, there is one market peculiarity about this paper, a thing nobody seems to notice to myself, and that is that it changes as the light changes. When the sun shoots in through the east window, I always watch that first long, straight moon. It changes so quickly that I never can quite believe it. That is why I watch it every minute. By moonlight, the moon shines in all night when there is a moon. I wouldn't know it was the same paper. At night, in any kind of light, then twilight, candlelight, lamp light, and worst of all, by moonlight, it becomes blars. The outside pattern I mean, and the woman behind it is as plain as can be. I didn't realize for a long time if the thing was that showed behind, that dim sub-time, but now I am quite sure it is alone. By daylight, she is subdued, but that fancy is the pattern the future shows still. It is so puzzling, they keep sneak-by by the hour. I lie down ever so much, and the time is as if it was written, and to sleep all I can. Indeed, each door is ahead of me, and the thing you lie down for an hour and a half, it is a very bad pattern I have to list. But you see, I don't see it. And that cultivates the seat, but I don't tell them on a rate. Oh, no. But after that, I hear a little prayer from you. It seems very clear to me, that even you have an inch of paper there. It strikes me, I tell you, but that's not a sign of stupidity. But that's not stupidity. I do not know if you know what I'm doing, because you suddenly are looking for solutions, not for the silver-times you're looking at the paper. And Ginny too, brought Ginny with her hand on her face. She didn't know what to do, and you always try to tell her, but she's very good. But it must be spreading in your puzzle. What she was doing with the paper? She turned around and said, she had been touched by a spirit, and it frightened me. That's the reason why I should threaten myself. Then she said, paper stains everything it talks, and she found no excuses and no life for it was in your hands. I see this from you, and you're perfect. Did not that sound innocent? But I am not studying at all. I am telling you, nobody should find out about myself. Life is so very much more exciting than history. This is even a self-ignored thing. I would call it the end of the world, but I will be there, and I'm not quiet in my words. The darkness is so sweet to see in pain. You have to go the other day, and so I see deep voice, and I say, I don't know about people. I tell you all the time. I had no reason to tell him, it was because of the law and paper. He had made fun of me. He might even want to take me away. I don't want to leave him until I've found it out. There is a week more, and I think that would be enough. That feeling ever so much better, I don't sleep much at night, but it is so interesting when you watch the movies. But I sleep a good deal in the daytime. In the daytime, it's a nice and neat place. There are always new sheets on the phones, and new shades of yellow all over it. I cannot keep counting them. You are outside, conscientious. It is the strangest yellow of that law, people. Nice and big of all the yellow things I ever saw. Beautiful ones like butter, the old and the old, bad and the old. If there's something else about that, people, the smell. I noticed it the moment we came into the room, there was so much fear and silence, not fear. Now we have found a beat of fog and rain, and part of the windows are open and knocked, and the smell is still here. It creeps all over the house. I find it cozy in the dining room, stulting in the hall, frightened in the hug, blind and weakling on the stairs. It's in my head. Even though I did a lot, I felt my head suddenly in surprises. There is that smell, such a peculiar odor too. I spent hours in the corner of the hall, discovering what it smelled like. It is not bad, at first, and very gentle, but quite the subtlest, most enduring odor I've ever met. In this damp weather it is awful. I wake up in the night and find it hanging over me. It used to destroy me at first. I thought seriously of burning the house, to reach the smell. But now I'm used to it. The only thing I can think of is that it is like the color of the paper, a yellow smell. There's a very funny mouth on this one. You lower down and clear the mouthboard. A street ranger and ranger. It goes between every piece of furniture except the bed. A long straight, even smorch, as if it had been rubbed over and over. I wonder how it was done, who did it, and what they did it for. Round and round and round, round and round and round, it makes me dizzy. I've really had to scubbish some people out. Through work and so much of it, when I changed the center, I finally found it out. The front fatter does move, and I wonder, the woman behind shakes it. Sometimes I think there are great many women behind, and sometimes only one, and she calls her out fast, and her crawling shakes it all over. Then in the very bright stars, she'll keep still. And in the very shady spots, if she gets hit full of the bars, they shake them hard. And she's all the time trying to climb through. But nobody could climb through that tower, explain with so. I think that is quite, there's so many heads. They get through, and in the pan, strangles them off, and turns them upside down, and makes their eyes fight. Those heads were covered with taking off, and they never got so mad. I think that woman gets out in the daytime. And I'll tell you what, I've seen her. I can see her out of every one of the windows. It is the same woman I know, where she is always creeping, and most lonely doing not creep by day-lights. I see her on that long road, and her trees, creeping around, and her curious parts, she hides under the black-birded mountains. I don't blame her bits. They must be very humiliating to be creeping by day-lights. Well, so, more of a creep by day-lights. But the other day night, there was a child with a sex on their lawns. And John is so peering now, that I don't want to irritate them. I wish she would take another ring. Besides, I don't want anybody to get that woman out at night but myself. I hope to wonder if I could see her out of all the windows at once. It plays as fast as I can. I can only see out of one at a time. And though I always see her, she may be able to fit faster than I can turn. I've watched her sometimes away all through the open country, creeping as fast as a cloud shadow in a high wound. If only that tough habit could be gotten off from the end of one. I mean to try it, little by little, I've found out another funny thing. That I shot teller at this time. It was not even the trustee of the watch. There are only two more days to pick this paper up. And I believe John is beginning to notice. I don't like to look in his eyes. And I heard you ask Ginny a lot of professional questions about him. She had a very good report to give. She said I slept a good deal in the daytime. John knows I don't sleep very well at night. But while I'm so quiet, I actually also took a fish tank to school and put the camera to be very lovely in the time. That is if I could see through him. Still, I don't wonder if you asked me to sleep in any of this paper for three nights. I'm just interested in it. But I feel sure John and Ginny are secretly affected by it. Hooray! This is the last day, but it is enough. John is to stay in town overnight and he'll be out until this evening. Does anyone need to sleep with me with a slob, you know? But I told her I should endavably rest better for a night all alone. That was clever. But I really wasn't alone with her. As soon as it was a new one, and a failed thing began to fall and shape the pattern, I got up and ran to help her. And I thought if she was sure, I should when she pulled. And before morning, he'd killed all the years of the paper. I stripped about a small, as many thin and half around the room. And then when the sun came and the awful pattern began to laugh at me, I declared I would finish it today. We go away tomorrow, and there all moving all my friends would down again to read things as they were to do. Ginny looked at the long amazement, but that's all her narrowing about to do a pure spite of the vicious thing. She laughed and said she wouldn't mind doing it herself, but I must not be tired. I should be tired of something. But I am, and no person touches this paper but me, not alone. She tried to get me out of the room, but it was too painful. But I said it was so quiet, and I didn't think, and I believed out of my belly and I'd sleep all I could. And not to wake me, even for a bit. I was so tired. And now she's gone, and so is gone, and things are gone, and there's nothing left but a great bedstead in a old bed and I'm going to tell you this now, in time. She's asleep, and now he's still in his room, and taking a bedstead in his room. And what is your room? You know where it is, huh? Well, there's no big room back here. There's a bedstead that's been long. And I said, and what do you want to do? I don't want to go, and what do you want to do? Anybody come here, and they're coming. And I said, and there were a couple of people, and they didn't see me, and they're coming. And that woman does get out, and tries to get away, and it gets in the way of her. But I forgot, I couldn't reach her, and I didn't need anything to stand on. This bed will not move. I tried to lift, and push it until I was laying. And then I got so angry, I bit off a little piece of my finger, but it hurt my teeth. They are pure off all the paper I could make standing on the floor. It sticks horribly, and the pattern just enjoys it. All those strangled heads, and bulbous eyes, and jubbly, fungus-bursts, just shriek with vision. I'm getting angry enough to be something desperate. I thought that the window would be an admirable exercise, but the bar was too strong and had a problem. Besides, I was angry. But, of course not. I knew well enough, this step like that is damn thought-providing, like I didn't miss a screw. I don't like to even look out of the windows. There are so many of us creeping in, and they creep so fast. I wonder if it all came out of that door, if they were in there. But I am still very fast in the middle, but my will didn't work. You don't get in media from the way you're there. I suppose I should have had that plan in mind on night, and that is poor. It is so pleasant to be out in this great way, and I think around these like things. I don't want to go inside. I won't. Even if Jean asks me to. Outside, you have to think on the ground, and everything is raining instead of the weather. But if you don't think on the ground, and my shoulder just fits me, that noise, you don't know. So I don't need to know. Why, there's a door at the door. There's no use running there. You can't get out of here. No, you don't. It's fine. You know, it's crying for a minute. There'll be a shame to break down that beautiful door. So I'm here, said I, named Jean's voice. The key is down by the front steps. I'm here crying for a minute. That's all I was telling you about. What do you say? What do you say? What do you do? What can't you say? The key is down by the front door, and you're crying for a minute. And then I said it again. So what time? I really didn't even mean to slow you. You said it so well, and you had to go to the sea. And he got it, of course, and came home. He's not short on the word. What is the motor, if you try? Good God's sake, what are you doing? I kept on thinking, just to see. But I looked at him over my shoulder. I got out at last, said I, in spite of you and Ginny.
