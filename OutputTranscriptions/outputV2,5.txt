 This is a hyperbatch of four of us. Our hyperbatch of four of us are in the California. For more information, please visit www.hyperbatch.org. The hyperbatch is available in the US, www.hyperbatch.org, www.hyperbatch.org, www.hyperbatch.org, It is very saddening to hear that many people like Johnny and myself have learned how to speak. I would say I want to pass. I'm sure that I'm going to be asked to not to. But still, I'm proud to say there's something clear about it. Perhaps why actually do we get so cheaply and why our speech is long-untinged because I'm not speaking the French. But one expects that in my opinion. So let's go back to the experience of Johnny, who has no patience with faith and since then, he has been able to do that and see and sit down and figure. Johnny is a physician, and perhaps, I wouldn't say I'm really sorry for it, but this is a great paper and a great belief in my mind. Perhaps that is one reason I do not look well at that stuff. You see, it does not believe I'm sick in what I'm doing. But the physician, I'm saying, when he was saying, she was saying that I'm not sick because there is very nothing to matter with her, but simply I'm nervous to question the psychosteria of contingency and what it's going to do. But whether it's also a physician or also a physician, and he says the same thing. So that's a phosphate, self-basp type, which I realize. And tonics and journeys and air and exercise and action will be forbidden to the world and so on and on again. Personally, I disagree with that idea. Personally, I believe in the new, the exciting machine that you need here. And what is one to do? A big effort by a physician that it carries a sass in a good deal, having to be so sighed about it or else meet with heavy opposition. I sometimes start to think about conditioning if I have less opposition in my society than skinless. But John says it's very interesting I can do, think about my condition and I can press and always make some food. So I don't reckon I'm willing to do that. The most beautiful place is quite alone, standing well back from the road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English places which you need to visit. There are hedges and walls and gates that lock and lots of separate middle houses for the gardeners and people. There is a blue nurses garden and another sass at the garden. Large and shady in a box-burning tent and lined with long, big, covered boxes with seats made of wood. There are green mountains too. They are all broken. There are some needle-shot levels and something back there with a few doors. The place is even input for real. That's the worst my grocery is smelling of food. But I don't care. There's something strange about that. I can feel it. I only said a second time and you know how I used to say that I thought you'd just drop it and shut the window. I get that news when they angry with John St. Thomas. I'm sure I never used to be so sensitive. I think it is due to the smearless condition that John said. I feel so. I should not touch the surface and so I take pain to console myself. I don't need it. I don't like my wounds. I want the one down the stairs with the pin on the top of the top and have razors all over the window and such as this old-fashioned machine-guns. But John is not here to show. He said there was only one window and not a room for two girls and no near room for him if I took another. He's very careful of another and hardly likes me so much. And hardly likes me scared of a special direction. I have a scared description for each girl in the room. It takes all care of me and so I feel basically invoked in what the value is doing. I said you came here so long ago that I was to have perfect rest and all the air I could give. Your exercise depends on your strength in what you're doing and your feet somewhat on the other hand. But air you can observe all the time. So you take the machine-guns and talk to the next one. Look at the big air room. The whole air room with windows that are wide and air on some side of the room. It was a nice little fit and insane and amazing. The windows are wide and a little chivalry. And there are wings and things in the world that are wide. The open paper with it's own rays that you can see in the world it is stripped off of the paper. And great patches all around the paper are built by the stars like a new image. And in a great place on the other side of the room there are grandfathers making fairy monsters to sing. There are many things you are in the family who now spend a lot of time in the fairy tale and who follow the only fairy tale the little fishies. The same can be said seriously. The grandfathers are the story of the fairy tale. The story of the fairy tale. The fairy tales are so far-moving and full of springy and snow-tongued salons. They look so but they look like a little saloon. A little saloon. No wonder the saloon is so beautiful. I should paint myself but I can live in this mean land where things turn and they must be quick as well. I'm glad I'm not a fairy. I've been here two years and I haven't felt like riding before since that first day. I'm sitting by the room to open this spacious nursery and there's nothing to hinder my life until I've reached the end of the journey. I'm driving away but I hope that even some nights in this case of a series I'm glad my things are not serious. These nervous troubles are directly with person. The sun does not know how much I owe you suffering. The nerves are made easy and suffering. I'm not satisfying some. But the worst is the only nervousness. It does burn me so much to be able to move you in the way. I meant to be such a popular such a real rest and popular and here I am I'm trying to prove that knowing your belief that an effort to do is what little you can do to address it and to change it. Another thing that is fortunate and that you're so good with a baby is such a good deal baby and yet that cannot be the only thing that makes me a slain of a show. I suppose it's a miracle that you're so good with this that person who took it in and afterwards you know the most beautiful girl and they can map in those words in the good way you say that after the war people's change it will be the heavy dead skin and then the power of the nose and then the girl ahead of the stage you say you know the place is doing the good and now you know that those characters in a good have just for a three months live can do that and stay downstairs and so there are such pretty women there that you took me in the time to find me a blessed little girl and said you were going to sell a little girl and have a white man and he's going to do it. Then he's like a black girl and he's like a black girl and he's entirely uncomfortable and he's feeling a little bit of a ghost and I'm comfortable and I'm not being so serious and I'm comfortable just for a few months. I'm not getting such fond of a ghost not because I'm not in the state of it not because I'm in the life and city government there's mistakes actually of the ghost and I'm just kind of a little bit of a ghost and this is what you need to know. I know this weakness about the mother I'm sure to you to admire what it said in the first place and I'd like to use my real and good sense to check it out. So I tell you I think sometimes when you find out only one who like you a little they believe the first right deal in your skin which I find a little bit of a tie of going to tell you and I'm so scared that I have been in the bus with a funny shit about the world and I get really well I join several and I'm feeling a little bit of a lonely wizard he says he'll as soon as put fireworks in my face I say let me have very stimulating people about the world I wish I could have a little faster but I must not think about that because paper looks to me as if it knew that I'd be just a little too late there's a bright spot for the funny noise of a broken neck and she dares to like and scare to the outside world but it's a positive and the importance of it and the other last things up and down sideways they fall and those are the same who believe in things that they believe it was really little rich with two gaps within the first and you have to ever think about what you're like and then you look at the world and there's so much more to question than anything else and we all know about much more to question than that and it's not a good thing to tell it's not a good thing to tell it's a strange reaction it's a strange reaction and most children just have a new choice of it I remember for the funny news about big bad news that the news and the news share what they see is what I'm saying thanks to people who knew the other things with two things talk about it and talk about it and be safe the furniture in this room is not nice to open the room so you have to bring it back up and down the stairs that's the first news of the family and they have to take the nursery from this country and no wonder and the resources that the children's group the law firm is turned out in a strange and stupid person in the world they must have had a fish of their own from the institution then the father of the strange of the notion of the city the faster it started to go it's great for putting food with the money coming in makes the people of the world better than the rich and the poor that comes from the system such a dear girl she is I'm so happy with her she's a good wife she's a nice old pastime she's a new director fashion she thinks she can stay white but I can not see how long it has been for a long time there is nothing in the world the love in the shade of the moon and the love that just makes our people a little closer the love that makes us a little closer too it is great for them to enjoy their lives this life is a little a little something a little different but particularly it is a little you can really see it in certain ways it's very big and not too late, right when you're facing something and you're listening to just so much you can see the strange the very things the families for the people who seem to spoke about that they want to see and can speak about that for some time there is just young strange well, the 4th of July is over the people are gone and all of them are scared out John thought not believe it so he just my mother who knows and she didn't know who he was but now he didn't do a thing the genius he was doing but it's not even the smile John said but don't forget about the smile who so soon needs to wear a sweater and he's got a lot of clothes he's not a fine dude and she says he's just like John and I'm glad he'll need more soon but there's such an understatement that she's done don't feel that it was worth done it's no longer over than anything I'm getting dreadful that she's done this and I'm glad I'm doing it and I'm glad she's done this but of course I don't think John's doing anybody else he's done that and I only know a good deal but John's kept in town very often and so he was patient and Zinny was scared and that's when he learned about the world so I got the idea that I'm glad I'm doing it except I'm the 4th one of the ages and my god I'm scared of that and I'm really getting found with the innermost aspect of it and she's got a lot of food it's as well as in my mind so I'm glad I'm doing this great and new to the world it is no longer and found that I'm glad I'm doing it but if there's a little bit of domestic in the food I stop this I stop and I'm glad I'm doing this but if I am I should know it today I should know that I love food it is the favorite food there you would like to be but I don't like steanya maybe the summer it'll be wonderful and I'll be hoping for always food But not other than that. Loot that in one way, each breath stands alone. The bloated courage and foreshes, a kind of V-based lumeness with delirium chimins, will wobble up and down our shaded columns of fertility. But on the other hand, they connect to the agony, and the strong outlines will not in great standing way, but to time, like a lot of well-worn seas in fair shape. The whole thing goes horizontally too, at least it seems so. I exhaust myself and stand at the same mission level as the one in my lecture. There needs a horizontal breath for a few years, and that has a wonderful sense of confusion. There is one in the beginning where it is almost in front, and there, in the cross-lights period, in the low sun shines directly at the finish, like an almost fancy in the evening at the end. The intimidating effects seem to fall on the realm of family sympathy, and rush out into the land of plunges of equally destruction. It makes me tired, tired. I will take a nap, I guess. I don't know why I should like this, I don't want to, I don't feel able, and I know, John, that I'm sorry, that I must say that I feel and think in some way that you're such an evil. That the effort is getting to the great human level. Back to time, when I was actually living in my grand-other's room, John says I miss him, he's my student, and he has me take to the river Ory and lots of tenants and things. He said nothing of air and wine and very neat. Dear John, he loves me dear, and hates to have me sick. I try to have a real earnest reason to talk to him about a dare, and serve on the issue that we go and make a visit to the same human being dear. But he said I wasn't able to go, nor able to stand it after I got there, and I did not make out a very good piece of myself, for I was trying to try to finish it. It is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight. I just assume that I'm not as good as I was. And dear John, gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed. I can sit by and he'll let me into a tired one. And when he said I was going to die, and he's pumpkin, and all he had, and that I must take care of myself of his sake, and keep well. He said no one but myself can help me out of this, but I must use my will and self-control and not let any safe answers unwaver me. There's one company, the baby is well and happy, and there's not half to occupy his commercial, but a car of well-paid. If we had not used it, the best of child would have. What a fortunate state. Why, I wouldn't have a child of mine, and question anything, who had in such a room for words. I never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John kept me here after all. I can stand so much easier than they do, you see. Of course, I never mentioned the baby in my life, but I think, watch it all the same. You know, things in that paper, nobody knows what I really mean. But when I found out I had a man, he was in shape, he was clear, whatever he was. I was in same shape, and he was very mean. And it is lucky that women, speaking down, and speaking about behind that pattern, I don't like it if it's, I wonder, if I'm going to think of a woman. I wish John would take me away from that. You see how I thought with John about my face, because he was so wise, and because he wasn't there. But I tried it, actually. It was mean, though. The moon shines in all around, just as he seemed to. I think you see it sometimes. I'm so sure. And now it's coming along another way. John was asleep, and I figured he was going to wake him up. So I kept staring, and watched the moon, and I thought, I'm going to be waiting the hour, because I thought, what's this? A big figure behind me seemed to shake the pattern. It was just as if she wanted to get out. I got up softly, and I couldn't hear. You see, if the paper didn't move, and when I came back, John was awake. I thought, what is it, little girl? He said, don't still walk about like that. You get told. I thought it was a good time to talk to him. So I told him that I really was not being a man, and that I wish he was taking me away. Why, darling, son of you, I wish we'd be up in three weeks, and I can't see how to leave before. There appears to not been at home, and I cannot possibly leave town just now. Of course, if you were in any danger, I could and would, but you really are better here, whether you can see it or not. I am a doctor here, and I know you're getting flesh and color. Your appetite is better. I thought it really much easier by she. I don't wear this long, said I, nor as much, and my appetite may be better in the evening when you are here, and you will be here in the morning when you are away. Bless her, let her hug, said you, the great, great, plug. She shall be as sick as she pleases. But now, let's improve the shining hours by going to sleep, and talk about it in the morning. And you won't go away? I am speaking. Why, how can I, dear? It is only three weeks more, and then we will take a nice little trip in a few days until Jenny is given the house lift. Many dear, you are better. Better in body, perhaps, I began, in stock shorts, very sad at stake, and you were such a stern, repurchive look, that I could not say another word. My darling, said he, I beg of you, for my sake and for our child's sake, as well as for your own, but you will never, for one instinct, let that idea into your mind. There is nothing so dangerous, so fascinating, to a temperament like yours. It is a gross and foolish fancy. Can you not trust me as a physician, whom I tell you so? So, of course, I say no more, Miss Bell, and we went to sleep for a long time. He thought I would sleep first, but I wasn't. And later, the hours found inside, and that front pattern and that back pattern, really did move together or second. On a pattern like this, by daylight, there is a lack of sequence, but the science of law, there is a constant irritance to a normal mind. Your color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating enough, that the pattern is torturing you. You think you're mashing, but just as soon as you get well under rain falling, it turns up back to sun itself and there you are, and it slaps you in the face, knocks you down, and shampoos up on you. This is like a bad dream. The outside pattern is a floored arabesque, reminding one of the fun with it. You can imagine a toadstool in turns, and in turn the worst thing that toadstool is, butting and scouting and endless convolutions. Why, that is something like it. There is, sometimes, there is one market for two years in the back of this paper, that nobody seems to notice with myself, and that means it changes as the light changes. When the sun shoots in through the east window, I always watch that first light, and it's glowing, straightening. It shines so quickly that I never can't quite believe it. That is why I watch it fade away. By moonlight, the moon shines in all night when there is a moon. I wouldn't know it was the same paper. At night, with any kind of light, and starlight, candlelight, lamp light, and wish it all by moonlight, there's bars, yes, I'd pat it on the moon, and the woman behind it is as clean as can be. I didn't realize for a long time that the thing was that shade behind it, that moon's safe from me, and now I'm quite sure there's a moon. By daylight, she's so blue, but, that fancy moon is the pattern that she should show still. It's so pleasant, it keeps me quiet by the hour. I lie down ever so much on the moon. John says it was listening. It's a scene by my hand. Indeed, he started to have it, and this is when you lie down and find out it's in tune. There was a very bad habit I was immersed in. But you see, I don't see. And that perpetuates the scene. But I don't tell him I'm awake, or I'll be married. The fact is, in being really afraid of the moon, it seems very easy to understand. And even to me, as an innocent, it's a good thing. It's striking me that she knows. It's just the same typical fact that the perhaps it is the creeper. I've watched John, and he did not know I was looking, and coming to the moon was certainly the most innocent species. Not having several times, looking at the paper. And she too, and I thought, she knew the hand on the box, and she didn't know how to move. And when I asked her, why, people showed very flat lips. But the most disconcerting man I've seen. And what she was doing was a paper. She turned around and said she had been caught stealing, and looked right in my eye. Asked me why I should frighten her so. Then she said that the paper stained everything it touched. And she had gone ill, and she had gone all my clothes and gowns. And she wished me to be more careful, and did not that sound innocent. But I know she was spreading the pattern. And I understand nobody should find out about myself. Why there's so very much more exciting than it needs to be. You see, I have something more to expect. I was very keen to act. I was, he said it, and a more quiet than I was. John was so pleased to see me improve. He laughed a little the other day. And said I soon would flourish, and be so proud of my wild paper. I turned back to the letter. I had no intention of throwing him. It was the cards of the wild paper. He had made fun of me. He might even have to take me away. I don't want to lose you unless you have a family member. There's a good girl. And I think that would be enough. Thank you and ever so much better, and I see much of myself, being so interested in the last developments. But I see the good deal in the daytime. In the daytime, you aspire something you think likes me. There are always new sheets on the frontiers. And new shades of yellow all over it. I cannot keep counting them. You are a child conscious of it. There was this strange yellow about the old paper. It makes me think of all the yellow things I ever saw. They were all beautiful ones, like butterflies. The old, wild, bad little things. But there's something else about that paper. The smell. I'm nervous, but the moment we came into the room, there was so much air and sun, it was not bad. Now you've got a lot of fog in the room, and for the windows are open and not, and the smell is still here. It stinks all over the house. It's funny, the buggy in the dining room, the stalking in the dining room, the hiding in the hall, the lying and waking in the stairs, the kitchen and the kitchen. Even when I go to work, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise it, there's that smell, such a peculiar odor too. I've spent hours in trying to find a reason to sign with snowmen. It was not bad at first, and very gentle. But quite the subtlest, most endearing I've ever met. In this damp weather, it is properly. I wake up in the night and find it hanging over me. I'd used to be staring at first. I thought seriously, burning the house to reach the smell. But now I'm used to it. The only thing I can think of is that it is like the color of the paper. A yellow smell. There's a very funny mark on this one, right? Blow down, if you need a mouthful. I speak one round of the moon. It goes behind every piece of function except the death. A long string, even smooch. As if it had been rubbed over and over. I wonder how it was done, if you get it. And what they did it for. Round and round and round. Round and round and round. It makes me dizzy. I've only had the stub of something at night. I've been watching so much around, but it's changed itself. I have finally found it out. The front pattern does move. And I wonder, the woman behind shapes it. Sometimes I think there are great many women behind. And sometimes only one. And she crawls around fast. And her crawling shapes it all over. Then in the very bright spots, she walks into the skill. And in the very shady spots, she just takes hold of the bars. And shakes them hard. And she's all the time trying to find food. There's nobody who can find food that pattern. Or strangles her. I think that's what they seem in their heads. They get food. And then the pattern strangles them off and turns them upside down. And makes their eyes bright. Those curves look like they've taken off and not looked back so bad. I think that woman gets out in the daytime. And I tell you what, by the way, I've seen her. I can see her out in every one of the windows. It is the same woman I know. She is always cranking and nursing and being mocked by their eyes. I see her in that long row under the trees. Thinking along. And when her tears comes, she hides under the black bang bones. I don't bang her bits. They must be very humiliating to be thought thinking by girls. I also, I often think that they're not humiliated enough. And I know John suspects something of that. And John is so clear-minded. And I don't want to irritate him. And I wish he would take another meaning. Besides, I don't want anybody to get that meaning out of my own self. I can only wonder if I could see her out of all the windows of the house. But she turns as fast as I can. I can only see her every one of the time. And though I probably see her, she may, in fact, be able to get faster than I can turn. I'd watch her sometimes away off in the open country. Thinking as fast as I can, I'll try to not die young. But when you've got the stuff that makes you look young, you can't come in. And when the slides, created by little, have found that I never found anything that I'd shot straight at your skin, it does not mean that you're supposed to come in. There are moments, moments, that you speak about, and I believe John begins to notice. But don't watch me look in the eyes. And I heard him ask Ginny a lot of professional questions about her. But she had a very good approach to do it. But she said I'd slap her good-by in the daytime. John knows I don't sleep very well at night. But I am so fine. He asked me, I asked a question, and she said, I think it's funny that he's very loving and fine. I'll try to see if I could see through him. Still, there's no money, no apps, no something I'm going to take with it. I'm going to make it. I'm not going to enter, it's funny. But I'm sure there's a lot of people to see. Hurrah! This is the last day, but it is enough. John is to stand down overnight, and won't be out until this evening. Is anyone going to sleep with me this afternoon? But I told her I should end down with me just better for a night all alone. That was clever, for I knew he wasn't alone at this. As soon as it was noon, and that poor thing began to call and shake the pattern, I got up and rang the door. I heard and she shook, and shook and she pulled. And the foremourning, we had killed off yards of the paper. We stepped about as far as my fit, and half on it in the room. And then when the sun came, and that thought of telling began to laugh at me, I declared I would finish it today. We go right to Marble, and they're all moving, all my furniture down again, to leave things as they were to go. It's any work of the while, an amazement. But I told her merrily that I'd get it out of a pure spite of the vicious thing. She laughed and said she wouldn't mind being with herself, but I must not get tired of it. I was so tired of it, I was so tired of it. But I am here, and no person says this paper but me. Not alive. She tried to get me out of the room. It was too happy. But I said it was so quiet and empty, and I believed I would lie down again and see all I could. I'm not to like me even for dinner. I was tired when I was here. She mentioned it's gone, and the servants are gone, and the things are gone, and there's nothing left that would best get a male batman who would come with me if she found it. We should see downstairs tonight, and take the boat home tonight. That's what I'm doing, my baby. How are these children, big scare about you? Yes, the best get us very much. But I must work. I have lots of things that only seem to mean to the things that I do. I don't want to stay up. I don't want to let anybody stand in the way of the window. But I must have some space for the ladies. I'd rather work up here than even jeans in this place. If that woman does get out and tries to get away, I can try her. But I forgot I could not reach her without anything to stand on. This bed will not move. I tried to lift and push it until I was laying. And then I got so angry, I bit off a little piece of one corner, but it hurt me too. Then I peed my head, and then I could use the same one for it. It sticks but horribly, and the pattern just enjoys it. All those strangled heads and bolder eyes and wobbly fungus gross just shrieked with durries, and I'm getting angry enough to do something desperate. I jumped out of the window with the annual extra service, but the bar was a tush down, and it was a mess. It was something that didn't work. But fortunately, all their women, who stepped like that, were in fire and were in the school. And they liked to even look out of the windows. They were so new, they were shaking women in their pink suit pants. I wanted to ask them all for a moment about that, but they were right here. But I am so fairly passing by, but my waist didn't work. You don't get me out of my way there. Basically, I should not have looked back before, and it's not a way it comes nice, and that is all. It is so pleasant to be out in this bright room and think around these ideas. I don't want to, I want to. I want to. You know what Jean asked me to. Outside, you have to keep on the ground, and everything is green and the same yellow. Right here, I think there's something on the floor. And my shoulder just fits me that long, smooth chin on the left, so I cannot lose my way. Why, there's Jean at the door. There's no leech on the man. Good thing I can access the door. I think there's five in the room. There's five on apps. They'll be ashamed to break down that beautiful door. Sorry, dear, said I, in the genius voice, but he is down by the first steps, and you're planting me. There's five, saying, broken down. We said, I'm broken down, baby. Broken me, girl. That's not the same. If he is down by the front door, and you're planting me, and then I said it again, several times, very good news, really. And he said it so often that he had the day to receive. And he got it before it came in. I stopped short on the door. What does it matter, he cried? Good God, say, what are you doing? I kept on thinking, just the same. But I looked at him over my shoulder. I've dried out at last, said I, in spite of you and Jean. And I pulled off most of the paper, so you can't hurt me back. Now, why should the man have offended? What he did, and ran across my path by the wall, so that I had to think over him every time. Then, girl, the girl we are taking, I show you the things you should do. I move it. Leave it. Do not say it again.
