the ladies were very good at the same thing in the invitation to the who all the visitors in the house lay out the necessary and it would not be to easter day almost a week after the gentlemans arrival but they were honored by such an attention and then they were nearly asked on even church to come there in the evening for the last week theyd seen very little of lady catherine and her daughter colonel fitzwilliam who called with the parcine edge more than one string but mr darius he did not hit on the scene at church the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherines drawing and her lady shook his ears and stood in the mirror it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darius much more than to any other person in the room colonel fitzwilliam seemed to be mad to see them anything was involved in relief to him at reasons and mrs collinss pretty friend had more of her confidencenancy very much he now seated himself by her and topped so agreeably a tent and hurtpreture of traveling and staying at home of new books of music that elizabeth had never been half so well intertainment that ring before and they could burst a so much spirit in flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as a mr darius these eyes have been seen and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her lady shook after a while shared the feeling was more open and he got a chance but she did not spit them all out what is that you were saying fitzwilliam what is it you were talking of how are you telling this bennett let me hear what it is we are speaking of music it is of all subjects my delight i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking music there are few people in england i suppose who have more to speak in the music than myself or a better natural taste if i had ever learned i should have been in great proficient and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed in lifefully how does georgianic anandarse mr darius spoke with affectionate phrase of his sisters proficiency i am very glad to hear such a good account of her for lady catherine and for her tell her for me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a book yet i am sure you know you are fine but she does not need so much so much for them it cannot be done too much and when i am afraid to hear i shall turn to not neglect it on any account i also tell young ladies that no excellent music is to be acquired without constant practice bye and then this is collins as the instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her from to rosings every day and play on the piano 14 and mrs jenkinsons room she would be a nobodys way you know in that part of the house thanks to garsley with her to the shame that his aunts bill of breeding and made no answer when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument he drew a chair near her lady catherine listened to her for the song and then talked as before to her other nephew so if a lot of walked away from her and making with the usual preparation towards the piano 14 station to himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenance elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said he needed frighteningly mr garcia by coming all in the state to hear me i will not be alone but you see his big dozen place alone theres a stubbornness about me that never can dare to be frightened at the will of others my courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me i shall not say youre mistaken he replied because you could not be belieably believed me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance longina to know that you find pain and occasionally could die whos who jar in the back not your own elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture herself i said to her if its wrong youre a cousin but youre very pretty notionally and to be a word ive heard ive heard to be clearly unlucky in me abel to expose my real character in a part of the world right hope to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr garcia is very ungenerous in you you can learn to follow the new way to the office advantage in her picture and give me leave to say very impolitic too for its provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as well shock you in the nations to hear im not afraid of you he said its mildly were in let me hear what you have to accuse him of crad colonel fitzwilliam i should like to know how he behaves amongst strangers oh you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in her picture you must know was it a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce into my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in one to the partner mr garcia you cannot deny the fact i had not at that time the honor of knowing any lady any assembly beyond my own party true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ballroom well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders perhaps so garcia i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but im ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers shall we ask her cousin the reason of this excuse me excuse me im not a person im a person since an education whos lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers well i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him its because he will not give himself the trouble i certainly have not the talent which some people possess sudarsi of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in it as the sentence is an offense to god my fingers settle elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do they have not did to be my own fault because i will not take the trouble of practicing it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right you have employed your time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting we neither of us perform to strangers here they were interrupted by lady miss bennett would not play a allness if she practiced more i could have the advantage of the london master she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to annes anne would have been a delightful performer had her help allowed her to learn elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he has sent it to his cousins prayers but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behavior to mr boy she derived this comfort from his bingley that he might have been just as likely to know her had she been his relation lady catherine continued her homework sometimes he was performed mixing her with the hand execution and paste elizabeth received the model for four parents of civility and with a request of the gentleman remained of the instrument till her lady shifts carriage was ready to take the model home end of chapter 31 read by christ and mcwilin tokyo japan november 7th 2005 this reading by christor lynch fied and pedulous by jane austen chapter 32 elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady something else through revenge three doors to substitute the goods to weil and let us end by our college and apologize for that question you dont look to be with me they are the twenty07 it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence reflecting when she had seen him last in heart for chah and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how fairly suddenly you were all quited never beyond last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to me that being it to see you all after him so soon if i let collect light he went back the day before he and his sister were well i hope when you left london perfectly so i thank you she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to another field again i have never heard him say so but it is probably it would be better for the neighborhood that should give up the place entirely for then we might so much for the convenience of the neighborhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle i should not be surprised at thus if he would give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers elizabeth made no answer she was afraid of talking long of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject he took the hint and seemed down with this seems a very comfortable house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins stood her kindness on a more grateful object mr collins appears to be very joyson is having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend hasnt excelled understanding and i am not certain i consider her madly mr collins is the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a potential light but it is certainly a very good match for her it must be very variable for her to be settled within so easier distant of her own family and friends an easy distance to call it it is nearly 50 miles no one watches 50 miles of good road little more than half a days journey yes i call it a bit as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family it is proof of your own attachment to heart for sure if anything beyond the neighborhood of longawaited i suppose would appear far as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancies she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and another field and she blushed as she answered i do not need this act of woman may not be settled to near her family the father in the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expenses of cleverly unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case here at last i have frequent journeys and i have persuaded my friend with not called herself near her family under less than half the present distance mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said ha ha he drew back his chair to conuse paper desirable he drew back his chair to conuse paper from a table a short burn in the circular path on right the side the legen can get in attackers przypgeon and get the tetatect surprised him mr darsom related the mistake which an occasion is including on mispenet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody went away what can be the meaning of this such charlatous as soon as he was gone my dear eliza must be on the field where he would never force his family away he could be the charlatous to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visits to proceed from the difficulty finding anything to do which was the more probable form of the time of year all field sports on over within dars there was lady catherine books and a brilliant table but gentlemen tell what all it would be in dars and in the nearness of the past all the pleasantness of the work to it or if the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking with a almost every day they called it various times in the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now in there the company by their arts it was claimed that all that could have been a brilliant came because he had pleasure in their society persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by her evident admiration of her a form of favor of children ahhh they were there and then she saw there was less captivating softness in turn if its williams manners people lived he might have the best informed mind but why mr darsy came softened at a pastnage it was more difficult to understand it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening its lips i want to speak it seemed the effort of necessity rather than of sure a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself he seldom be in really animators but this is collins new not to what to make of him colonel that william is occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was genuinely different but your own… the effect of love and the object of that love our friend eliza she set herself to work to play to watch him whenever they were at road scenes and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success he certainly looked at her friend but the expression of that look was disputable it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration and sometimes seemed nothing but absence of her the advance or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of radio but they changed which might be unique and did disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not a doubt that all her friends dislike with vanish if she could have supposed him to be in her power in her kind scheme of movement she suddenly found her marrying colonel fitzgerald from palaisin the most pleasant matter he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible what could count about its these advantages mr darske considered the patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all chapter 33 more than once in elizabeth in her mamma were getting the park unexpectedly clear to the verse she felt all the verseness of mrs charles who think hed been no one else was bored and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him of the verse that it was a favourite horn of hers how it could have cursed second to the most important part of his familys form hes a bit different and hes a bit different it seems like one fullscale nature of a volunteer cent for those of you who were not merely a huge formerly inquiring and an awkward pause and then away but he actually was the worst he never said a great deal in order to give herself the trouble of talking for a blessing of much but it struck her in the course of her her love solidly warps and her opinion that mr and mrs collins is happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the hams he seemed to expect then whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too his words seemed to imply it could he have colonel fitzgerald shes posed if he met anything he must mean an illusion to what might arise in that quarter it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the payals opposite the past niche she was engaged one day she walked and perusing james last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being against his place by mr duns she saw him looking up that colonel fitzgerald meeting her putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way i have been making a turn of the park you know as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the past niche why are you going much farther i know i should have turned in a moment and according to me she did turn and they walked towards the past niche together do you certainly leave kent on saturday said she yes if darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he arranged his business just to see places and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least played with all two of us he looks into the end of the music to enjoy the power of doing what he likes more than mr darcy he likes to have his own way very well it means of having it to the many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speak feelingly a younger son you know must be endured to selfdenial independence in my opinion the youngest son of an earth an island dependent well if you be a victim of a month of money and going wherever you choose or for curing anything you had a fancy for these are home questions perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that niche but in matters of greater weight i make sure that i dont want a mother youngest son cannot marry they like unless they like women are forks which i think they very often do our habits of expense make us too dependent and there were too many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money is this thoughtless but meant for me and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray was it a usual place in an earth youngest son unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask about £50000 he answered him in the same style and the subject had walked to interrupt a silence which might make him fencing or affected with what had passed she soon after said i imagine your cousins watching down with him cheat me to the sake of having someone as he disposal i wonder hes not married as hes a criminal lasting you know if its william that is the verdict which he must divide with me i am joined with him in the guardianship of mr seek are you indeed and say whats the verdict do you make theres your charge giving much trouble young ladies are per way just someones a little difficult to manage she has the true darsage spirit she may like to have her own way as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed to missdarsi likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth she directly replied and you need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her id i dare say she would have left the motifs to the normal youre the very great thing for the ladies and white acquaintance mrs hurst and miss bingley i think ive heard you say that you know them i know them a little there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there im something that had told me not you and ive been here i havent been here for too long ive been here for too long but i want to beg his pardon i have no rights to pose the thing that he was the person that was all conjecture what is it that you need its a circumstance which does you not wish to be genuinely known because if it were to get the round to the ladies family you would be an unpleasant thing you may depend on my not mentioning i know i dont wanna spending no issues with you and you are totally pred guilty this is why i have my prophet one book im really sorry to get my breakfast he must have messed up and then if heife what would be either of all his things or others vice versa the whole of last summer did mr darcy give you reasons for this interference i understand there were some of the strong objections against the lady and what art did he use to separate them he did not talk to me i dont know thats what i was saying only told me what i have now told you elizabeth made no eyes when walked on her heart swelling with indignation i am thinking of what you have been telling me essentially your cousins condo does not suit my feelings and why was he to be the judge you are rather disposed call his interference perficious i do not see what light mr darcy had to decide on the deprived of his friends imagination all why upon his judgment alone he was the determined and done lecturing what man and his friend was to be happy but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case that is not a lecture for me that is a lesson to her so just a picture of mr darcy that you have not trust herself with an answer and therefore a block of change in the conversation taught on intercept matters until they reach the person their shunt into her own room as soon as their vista left them she would think without her and then though with whom she has connected they could not exist in the world too that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate bingley and james he had never doubted but she had always had treated him that he however did not mislead him he was the cause he is providing to priests with a cause all of jane had said i have still continued to suffer he had ruined flaw while every home of happiness for the most affectionate most generous heart in the world and no would say how last he would eat would make him infrequent and dont strong objection probably were they were having one open in a country attorney and another who was in business in london to jane herself she explained there could be no possibility of objection all lovely innocent goodness as she is but understanding excellent her mind influenced at her man as captivating and neither could any of her parents would have left far but though with some peculiarities her abilities missed a darcy himself need not to stay and respect a ability which he would probably never eat when he thought of her mother her confidence gave away a little but she would not allow that any objection there had material weight with mr darcy whos pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want to be its been important in his friends connections than from their want to be set that you have quite decided last that he had been part of the government by this worst point of sight the adjation is which the subject occasion brought on a heavy see it determined her not to attend her cousins to roseings where they were engaged to drink tea this is collins seeing that she was really unwell did not pressure to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from fessing her but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension at lady catherines being rather disturbed all in regards to reporting is not in a book dummy the more information or to volunteer please visit librevoxorg today is ringing by tire shalinder wwwkrayorg pride and prejudice by jane austen chapter 34 and 35 when they were gone he was a best as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since being in kent she contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any kind of each there was a wand of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style as which proceeding to mr darcy of a mind that he used with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone had been a pain the sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal mr darcy shamed full boasts of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a key in her sense of her sisters sufferings it was some consolation to think that his visit to rossings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should its by all that affection could do she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him while someone knew that he was suddenly realized by the sound of the doorbell i just saw his mothers blood on the bed who had once been so ugly to me i never knew that i could not remember that i particularly after her but this idea was soon vanished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr darcy walking to the room in a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better she answered him with cold civility he sat down for a few moments and then he got walked about the room he was about once surprised so im not worried after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began in vain i have struggled it will not do my feelings will not be repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression she stared colored doubted and of a silent this he considered sufficient encouragement and the a vowel of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed he felt that he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride his sense of her inferiority of it being a degradation of the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination or dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence of a wound but was very unlikely to recommend his suit in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavors he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand as he said this he could easily see that he had no doubt of a favorable answer he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed such a circumstance could only as i was asked for and when he saw her he was able to see her in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments of out however unequally they made a mistake he was natural on that obligation and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgement of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation mr darseem who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentful and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature he was struggling for the the cause was to lose a ball seen as a red rock at length with a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honor of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavor at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance i might as well inquire replied she why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for instability if i was unsimble but i have other provocations you know i have had not my feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favorable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps forever the happiness of a most beloved sister as she pronounced me the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for capris and instability and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutist kind she posed and saw with no slides in the nation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse he even looked at her with a smile of affected and crudulity can you deny that you have done it she repeated with assumed tranquility he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been kinder than towards myself he was above disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you is decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham on this side imagine a act of friendship can you hear defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you hear impose upon others you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened color who that knows what his misfortunes had been in and he was not arrested as misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great in the energy you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have witnessed how he had advantages which he must know you have defied the best years of his life of that independence which was no less this due than his dessert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully my thoughts according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offenses might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impaled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by everything but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just would you expect later rejoice in the inferiority of your connections to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own it was about felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way then as it spared the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentle and like manner she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification she wont be able to do it moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain for the feelings of others were such as to form the groundwork of this appropriation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry you have said be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness and if these words he hastily left the room and he lissabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house the tumult of her mind was now painful and great she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness set down and cried for half an hour her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it but she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy that he should have been in love with her for so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which monster care at least would equal force in his own case was almost incredible it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong and affection but his pride his abominable pride his shameless evolve of what he had done with respect to jane his unparadable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny so overcame the people who took the situation and took the character had for a moment excited she continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room chapter 35 elisabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of anything else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise she was proceeding directly to her favorite walk when the recollection of mr darcys sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led farther from the turnpike road the park pailing was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground after walking to or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verger of the early trees she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove with edge its being mr darcy she was directly retreating but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards the gate he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of hotly composure i have been walking in the grove sometime in the hope of meeting you will you do me the honor of reading that letter im just a little bit tired of it im just a little bit tired of it but with the strongest curiosity he was a bit open containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand the envelope itself was likewise full pursuing her way along the lane she then began it it was dated from rosings at 8 oclock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you i write without any intention of painting you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will be stowed unwillingly but i demanded of your justice two offenses of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honor and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr wickham willfully and wantingly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favorite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whos affected but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respect the each circumstance i shall hope to be in the future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be affected i can only say that i am sorry the necessity must be obeyed and further apology would be absurd i had not been long and hurt for sure before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any of his feeling as serious as a country i had often seen him in love before at that ball while i had the honor of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be on the side from that moment i absorbed my friends behavior annuitably and i could then perceive that his partiality for misbendant was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him your sister i also watched her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment if you have not been mistaken here i must have been an error your superior knowledge of your sister must make the matter probable if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable but i shall not scrupal to assert that a serenity of observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched that i was desirous of believing her indifferent as certain but i will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great and evil to my friend as to me but there were other causes of repudence causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavored to forget because they were not immediately before these causes must be the break its a solution in that mothers family it was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sister it seems that you have to be a good friend of mine it seems that you have to be a good friend of mine relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the likesensia is praised no less generally be stowed on you and your elder sister then it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection he left another field for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning the part which i acted is now to be explained his sisters unisiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and a likesensable that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london we both were the only things to be offered so pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice i described and enforced them earnestly however this rum and struns might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving of your sisters in difference if not with equal regard but bingley has great natural model to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point to persuade him against returning into our friendship in part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condecended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister is being in town i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant that they might have met without illconsummed since perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however and it was done for the best on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer if i have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learned to condemn them with respect to that other more weak by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can send more than one witness of undoubted veracity you stir it to me as the son of a very respectable man who had foreman joys the management of all the pemberliest states and whos good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be a service to him and on george wittler i have not seen her my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentlemans education my father was not only fond of this young mans society but also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it as for myself it is many many years since i first began different manner this is propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr darcy could not have here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wittler has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character it adds even another motive my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr wittler was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancements in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant there was also a legacy of £1000 his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr wittler came wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate peculiarity advantage and lieu of the performance by which he could not be benefited he had some intention he added of studying law and i must be aware that the interest of £1000 would be a i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to exceed to his proposal i knew that mr wittler ought not to be a clergyman the business was therefore soon settled he resigned all claim to assistance in the church where it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return £3000 all connection between us seemed now dissolved i thought too ill of him to invite him to happen or admit his society in town in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation for about three years i heard little of him but on the deceit of the incumbent of the living which happened his time for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad he had found the law a if i would present him to the living question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this in treaty or for resisting every repetition to it his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstance as in his reproaches to myself after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped how he lived i know not but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrets my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the garden and ship of my mothers nephew proud this work and from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and they also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for their proof to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs young in whose character we were most unhappy deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affection at heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to any loatement she was then but 15 which must be her excuse and after stating her improvements i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elotement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father etnologed the whole to me you may imagine what i felt and how i acted regardless for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left the place immediately and mrs young was of course removed from her charge mr wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is £30000 but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revengeing himself on me was a strong inducement his revenge would have been complete indeed this adam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope equip me henceforth of cruelty towards mr wickham i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed for the truth of everything here related i cannot appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confining my husband and that may be the possibility of consulting i shall endeavor to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning i will only add god bless you fitzwilliam darcy end of chapter 35 recorded on november 12th 2005 in oceanside i will not be able to do this this is a missing part according to all the briefbox recordings or a public domain for more information on how to volunteer please visit violaorg i did not project this by jane austen chapter 36 if elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents but such as they were it may go to the schools tell eagerly she went through them and what a contrary of emotion babe the only apology to be in his power instead vastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which had just sense of shame would not conceal with a strong prejudice against everything he might say she began his account of what had happened in that another field she read with an eagerness which hardly meant her power of confidential and from impatience of knowing what the next day was it was implanted to the sense of the one before her eyes his belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but hearty it was all fine but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham when she read with somewhat clear attention a relational event which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming and affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition a astonishment apprehension and even horror a pressur she wished to discredit it entirely repeated and exblaming this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehood and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look at it again in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself the kindness of the late mr darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great what wickham has said at the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was grossly implicitly unanswered or whatever and for a few minutes she thought it was a pleasure to be here with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of which was there and all pretensions of the living i was receiving in it again she was forced to hesitate she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality derograted on the poor woman in each statement but with little success on both sides it was only assertion again she read on but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed impossible that any contriving could serve it was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole the extravagance and general profligacy which hes exceedingly shot turned but as she could bring no proof of its injustice he never heard of him before his entrance into the char milosha in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance of his former way of life nothing had been known in heartfatured but what he told himself as to his real character had information been in her power one night that is the purpose of her first in the possession of every virtue she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue a tone for those casual errors under which she could endeavor to class what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continue but no such recollection rebre friended her she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighborhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read but alas the story which followed of his designs on mr darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwalium and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwalium himself from she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no reason to question at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr hardercy would never have hazarded such a proposal he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr phillipss many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wonder it had escaped her before she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcy that mr darcy must leave the country but that he should stand as crown yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quit the country he had told his story to no one but herself the shirt her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the sun how differently did everything now appear in that he was concerned his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenaries and the mere of her but he was the best husband his behavior to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his friend to be very busy with her preference which she believed she had most unconsciously shown every lingering struggle in his favor grew fainter and fainter and in father justification of mr darcy she could not but allow mr bainley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in me affair the house of his wifes brothers she had never been the most force of her acquainted and the queen tits which had run through the rock and clucks together and given her a sort of intimacy with his wifes husband and even the queen to the other ones uphold or unjust anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wikam had allowed her as a relationship which in the of his sister has to prove him capable of some emiable feeling that had his actions been what mr bikam represented them so gross of violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an emiable man as mr bainley was incomprehensible she grew absolutely ashamed of herself of neither darcy nor wikam could she think without feeling she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd how despicablely i have acted to cry i who have prided her as im on my discernment and who have valued my self on my face from herself to jane from jane to jane her thoughts were in the line of which soon brought to her reference her that mr darcys explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again why itd be different was the effect of the second perusal how could she deny that credit to his assertions she had been obliged to give him another he declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachment and she could not help remembering what charlottes opinion had always been neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane she felt that janes feelings though fervent were little dissuade and that there was a constant complacency in her in her met air and manner not often united with great sensibility when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which she particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disappropriation could not be a singleminded person the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt its suathed but it could not consul her for the contempt which had thus been selfattracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that janes disappointment a materialy the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed to be on anything she had ever known after walking along the lane for two hours giving me a wink every break insiling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden a sweet heart a routine and a recollection made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as mustmake her unkilled for conversation she was in the house during her absence mr garsey only for a few minutes to take leave but that girl sitting with them at least a narrow hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him she really rejoiced to think only of her letter end of chapter 36 chapter 37 the two gentlemen left roses the next morning and mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obey sense was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected the roses were in recent to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her lady ship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desires of having had collecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her lady ships ending nation would have been what would she have said how would she have behaved the questions were what she didnt understand the first subject was the denomination of the roses party i shall at least i believe no one feels the loss of friends as much as i do but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessive to sorry to go but so they always are the dear colonel rally to spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it more acutely i think the last year his attachment to roses certainly increases mr collins had a compliment and an illusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter lady catherine observed after dinner that misspen it seemed out of spirits and immediately accounted for it by herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added but if that is the case you must write to your mother and faith that you may stay a little longer mrs collins will be very glad of your company i am sure i am much obliged to your lady ship for your kind invitation replied to elizabeth but it is not in my part to accept it and must be in town next saturday why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks i expected you to stay two months i told mrs collins so before we came there can be no conclusion for you going so soon mrs benick could certainly sprain for another fortnight but my neck cannot be broken i am very mad your father of course may spare you if your mother can doctors are never so much consequence to a father and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the brosm i am sure that you will be able to do this if you are not a jack to take a newborn as you are neither of you large you are all kindness maam but i believe we must abide by our original plan lady catherine seemed resigned mrs collins you must send a servant for them you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves it is highly improper i must contrive to send somebody i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life when my niece virginia went to landscape last summer i made a point of having two men serving school with her mr see the daughter of mr darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner i am excessively attentive to all those things you must send john with the young ladies mrs collins i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone my uncle was to send a servant for us oh youre uncle he keeps a mans servant does he i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things where shall you change horses oh broadly of course if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections mr darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart she stood at every sentence and had feelings towards its writer where at times widely different when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and that braved him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion general character was sent the ship had to prove him nor could she be the ship had to prove him nor could she be the ships in the dead the ships in the dead there was a constant source of affection and regret and in the unhappiness of her family a subject of yet heavy hardship and they were hopeless of remedy her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild kiddiness of his young gestators and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible to the evil elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavor to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence what chance could their beef of improvement cat cat he would be the undermedia hed always been affronted by their advice and lydia selfwilled and careless would scarcely give them hearing they were ignorant i dont think they while there was an officer in mariton they would flirt with him and while mariton was within a walkoflong board they would be going there forever anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern and mr darcys explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost his affection was proved to have been catch to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for her happiness jane had the deep deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family when to these recollections was added the development of wooden character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it impossible for her to appear taller when they came to the bottom for a difficult morning the last speaker came to her store as they had been approached the very last evening was spent there and her ladyship again inquired my neatly into the particulars of their journey gave them directions the place in gowns in the only right way that mariah thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her children fresh when they parted lady catherine with great attention wish them a good journey and invited them to talk to hansford again next year and mr berg exerted herself so far as to curtsy and hold out her hand to both and after 307 this is a libby box reporting all the libby boards are in the library the one on the show visit libboxorg recording by sherry crowley pride and reggies by jim resson chapter 38 on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast for two minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity to pay for five in seven and the switch between them and the space of the office i know not mr elizabeth said to you whether mrs collins has heard of her she will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it the favor of your company has been i mean im making the rest of time i mean there are humble abode our plain manner of living are small rooms and few domestic and the little we see of the world must make hansford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for that and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly elizabeth was eager with her thanks and experiences of her she was very successful in creating giant and the pleasure of being with sherry and the kind attention she had received must make her feel obliged mr collins was gratified and with more smiling salamity it gives me great to me done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connections with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flat her ourselves that your huntsford visit cannot have been entirely orc some our situation with regard to lady kaufmans family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which view can boast you see on what a footing we are you see how continually we are engaged there in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble personage i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion while they are shared its an expression for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk above the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few shant scientists you may in fact carry a fairy tale lady catherines great attention stins collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trusted does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially at which you equal physicality emerge my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each other elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts she was not sorry however to have a recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang it was more important for her to such society but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were so she did not seem to ask for compassion her home and her house keeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their children at length which was known the transfer fastened on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be read and gave an affectionate earning to the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respect all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received that long day in the winter and his compliments to mr mr mr scott though unknown he then handed her in mariah followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hither to forgotten to leave any messages for the ladies at rosings but you are with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here elizabeth made the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage trolled off good gracious cried mariah after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened a great manion did set her companion with the sigh we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice how much i shall have to tell their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their daily concert jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her students and it is the various young age ones which the kindness of her and her reserved for them but jane was to go home with her and at longborn there were meanwhile that she could wait even for longborn before she told her sister of mr darcys proposals to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly as donna shane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reasonly such a temptation to open us as nothing could have been conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of beingly which might be chapter 39 it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from grace church street for benets carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans punctuality aaaaaaah girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite millner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a salad and cucumber after welcoming their sisters they try and fords explain is this not nice is not this an agreeable surprise and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent hours at the shop out there then showing her purchases here i thought that i can get it i can get it very pretty im not gonna let it go by then but i cant pull it this big and its like a hole and see if i can make it up any better and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i bought some prettier colored satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very colourful besides it will not much signal if i want one more to the summer after the militia have left meriton and they are going in a fortnight are they indeed cryoed elizabeth with great satisfaction they are going to be in camp to near brighton and i do so want papua to take us there for the summer it would be such a delicious ski and i do see the cost hardly anything at all no but two of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall have yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful skim indeed and completely do for us at once good heaven brighton and a whole handful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meriton now i have bought some news reports in the beginning as they said oh thats a good news news and about a certain person we all like jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told he need not stay lydia laughed and said i that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the waiter must not hear as he peered i dared say he often hears but he is an ugly fellow i am glad he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for my news it is about to your wickham too good for the waiter is it not theres no danger of wickhams marrying mary king theres for you she has gone down to her uncle that never could go on to stay woodens seat and mary king is safe out of elizabeth see if i can let her in could have tested her for sure she is a great friend going away if she liked him but i am sure there is no strong attachment on either side said jane i am sure there is not on his i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her who could about such a nasty little freckled thing elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such courseness of expression herself the courseness of this as soon as all had inked and the elder ones paid i carried her as ordered and after some contrivence the whole party with all their boxes purchases were seated in it how nicely we are all primed in probably the day i am glad i got my bonnet and it is only for the fun of having another bonnet well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away have you seen any pleasant men have you had any flirting she has become a 133 laura how ashamed i should be of not being married before 23 i love you so much first of all thank you she says lizzie had better have taken mr collins and i do not think there would be any misunderstanding and then i would shut the room to you about to all the balls dear me we had such a good season from the other day at colonel fosters kityan me were to spend the day there and mrs foster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the vine mrs foster and me are such friends and so she asked the two herringlings to come but harriet was ill and so pan was forced to come and then would you please be with me lets go in womens clothes im purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun not a soul new of it but colonel emissus foster and kityan me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so didnt mrs foster i thought i should have died and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was in the living room with such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes delidia assisted by kityans hints and additions endeavor to amuse her companions all the way to longong elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of what its made there were suction at all and more than one stringed dinner did mr bennett say voluntary to elizabeth i am glad you are back lizzy theyre party in the dining room with large for almost all the lucasis came to meet mariah and hear the news in various where the subjects that occupied them lady lucas was inquiring of mariah after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter the present fashions from jane who sat way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger lucasis and lydia and a voice louder than any other persons was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody and with us we had such fun as we went along kityan i drew up the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kity had not been sick and when we got to the church i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with a nice cold nice human world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought wed never show up i was ready to do it after and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that anybody might have heard of us and i was out but far beyond from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures they would dont escape congenial with the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms for me i should infinitely prefer a book but all of this answer lydia heard not a word she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to mariton and to see how everybody went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme it should not be said that the misvenants could not be home after date before they were interested with the officers there were ladies and two they could not position she could not position and when we saw two we figured that law was positive the public to her of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression in a fortnight they were to go and once found she hoped that could be nothing more to play her on a musical she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brightens when discussion between her parents elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet disappeared of succeeding at the last end of chapter

pregitis by jane austen chapter 40 elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome in preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself ms bennetts astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved with the obvious of the justice to her feelings for her his being so sure of succeeding was wrong she said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment she has other feelings shes regarded for me you do not blame me however for refusing him blame me blame your parents you were wrong what you did but you will know it when i tell you what happened the very next day she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham what a stroke this was for poor jane who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual nor was darcys vindication though rad kakubal of consoling her for souch prove the probability of error and seek to clear the one without involving the other this will not do settle elizabeth you never will be able to make both of them good for anything take your choice what you must be satisfied with only one theres pressure point of view of narrative just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all darcys but you shall do as you choose it was sometime however before a smile could be extorted from jane i do not know when i have been more shocked suchy wickham so very is almost passed by the mr darcy dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too having to relate such a thing of his sister it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel it so oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both i know you will do him such ample justice and i am growing every moment more unconfirmed and indifferent your confusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner you certainly was some greatness management in the education of those two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it the other one has got all the appearance of it as you used to do and yet i meant to be uncomantly clever and taking so decided to dislike to him without any reason this such a spur to ones genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may ah without now and then stumbling on something withy lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now and do you i was uncomfortable enough i may say unhappy and with you no one to speak been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions and speaking of wickum to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is the most natural consequence of the prejudices i have been encouraging there is i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintances in general understand wickums character im sorry im sorry im sorry surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully what is your opinion that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy is not authorized me to make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i i just dory to the selfviolent but it would be the death of half the good people in mariton too attempt to place him in an amiable i am not equal to it wickum will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is sometimes hands it will be all found out then we made laugh at their stupidity and not knowing it before that present i will say nothing about it you are quite glad to have his errors made public by killing him forever he is now perhaps suring for what he has done an anxious curious establish a character we must not make him desperate the tumult of elizabeths mind was delayed by this conversation she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either something lurking of which prudence forbade the disclosure she dared not relate since surely she had been valued by her friend here was knowledge in which no one could partake she was not anything less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her and throwing off this last and combrance of mystery and then she if that the trouble weve been should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the liberty of communication can not be mine to let his lost all its value she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters sisters sisters still jingling and her affectional love having never even fathomed herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness so lets all close so lets go late did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquility well lizzy said mrs bennett this is your opinion i dont know this is sad its just a joke for my part i am determined never to speak it again to anybody jane saw anything of him in london well he is a very disciple as if theres the distant chance the world of her ever getting him now theres no talk of his coming to netherfield again on his summer i do not believe he will ever live at netherfield anymore oh well it is just as he chooses nobody wants him to come though i shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and think you will be sorry for what he has done but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any summer expectation she gave no answer well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so that the collins live fairy comfortably do they well well i only hope it will last and what sort of table do they keep charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in their house i dare say no nothing at all a great deal of good management depend upon it yes yes they will take care not to outrun their income do them and so i suppose they often talk of having long borne when your father is dead they look upon it quite as their own idea say whenever that happens it was a subject which they could not mention before me but they often talk of it between themselves well if they can be easy within a state that is not lawfully their own so much better i should be ashamed of having long been the only tale of me and jack what jack before you want the first week of their return was soon gone the second began it was the last of the regiments day in mariten and all the young ladies in the neighborhood who took a piece the objection was caused by the universe now the elder misbemenates alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employment very frequently where they were approached for this in the sensibility by kitty and lydia whos home misree was a stream and who could not comprehend such hardheartedness in any of the family good evan what is to become of us what do we do would they often exclaim in the there are fiction and mothers shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and 20 years ago i am sure sitchie i cried for two days together when colonel millers regiment went away i thought i should have broken my heart i am sure i shall break mine send lydia if one could but go to brighton observe mrs bennett oh yes one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagreeable a little sea bathing would set me up forever and my aunt phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good added kitty such were the kind of lamentation she was sounding perfectly through her own house on his bed tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame she felt a new the justice of mr darcys objections and never had she lost her heart and his own heart she was to pardon his interference in the views of his friend but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment this is the very young woman and very lately married our resemblance in good humor and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of there three months a quaint they had been intimate too the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs forster the delight of mrs forster and the mortification kitty are satisfied to be described holy inattentive to her sisters feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy calling for everyones congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever while the lockless kitty continued in the parlor repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accident was she was a peepish and not simply by mrs forster should ask me as well as lydia such as you though i am not her particular friend i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned and she resigned which are all defamed for frank letaansigt house and also made that make her miserable but still she said that she received love and she answered at her vinegar and always chew of her face into her happy face but she agreed to repeat it and that had owns half the alumin and with her presented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behavior the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster and the public will be yet more impreendent with such a companion at brain peritendably and then said lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in the presence of the public we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances if you were aware sit a little bit the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and impre name which is already a reason from it i am sure you would judge differently on the affair all ready a reason could you mr pen what as she frightened me away saying to you the lovers poor little lizzy but do not be cast down such a squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret come let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydias folly indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not a particular kind of general evils which i am now complaining our importance are respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydias character excuse me where i must speak plainly if you might dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment her character will be fixed she will be at six feet of the most determined to see her ever made herself or her family ridiculous a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite in this danger kitty also is comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vane ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrolled the only dear father can you suppose it is possible that they will not be censored and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace mr bennett saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply do not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to be censored very silly sisters we shall have no peace at longborn if lydia does not go to brighton let her go curve forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt that she has been here officers will find women better worth their notice horizon us to lock her up for the rest for life with this answer of this the nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them she was confident of having performed her duty and de fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation of her found expression in their united volume ability in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gaybeating place two tens and two scores of them at present unknown the glorious of the camp its tense stretched forth in utious uniformity of lines crowded with the young in the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath the tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects they could have been understood only by her mother whom might have felt her but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little indermission to the very day of lydias leaving home elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of formal versatility entirely so she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her and affectation and to see this this is gods theory in his present behavior to herself she had a foreshort of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of her evening those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her she lost all concern for him and finding herself thus selected as the object of such idol and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feed whatever cause his intentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal on the very last day of the regiments remaining at mariton he dined with other of the officers at longborn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humor that on his making some she mentioned current swillions and mr darcys having both spent three weeks at roses and asked him if he was acquainted with the former he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanly like man asked her how she had liked him her answer was warmly in his favor with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you say he was at roses nearly three weeks and you saw him frequently yes almost every day his manners are very different from his cousins yes very different but i think mr darcy improves upon acquaintance indeed right mr wickham and pray may i ask but checking himself he added in the gayer tone is it in address that he improves has he dined to add ought of civility to his ordinary style for i dare not hope he continued in a lower oh no settle this with in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning there was a something in her countenance which means her hands and hands and hands and hands and hands and hands i did not want to do this my daughters manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feeling toward mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to fall in love with his heart in that direction may be of service if not to himself too many others for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that the sort of cautionness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of which good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with mr berg which i am certain he has very much at heart but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old selfinterpreter and she was in no humor to indulge him the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of useful cheerfulness but with no further attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they part of her we will desire of never meeting again when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to meriton from once they were to set out at that time kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did we from taxation and envy mrs bennett was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible at vicewitch there was every reason to believe would be well attended to and in the glamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle abuse of her sisters were uttered without being heard and of chapter 41 this is a libravox recording a libravox recordings are in the public domain for more

from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of congigal felicity or domestic comfort her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humor which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in the marriage put an end to all real affection for her respect esteem and confidence had vanished forever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown but mr bennett was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had a risen his principal enjoyment to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted when as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where are other powers of education if our wantons the true philosopher of the world has arrived benefit from such as our given he listened to us however had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behavior as a husband she had always seen you with pain but respect the husbands abilities and grateful for her affection and treatment of herself she endeavored to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly remorse but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable marriage nor ever been sooooooooooooooooooo direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if he can take more of a part of life when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repindings at the dullness of everything around them through a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbs of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp upon the whole therefore she found what has sometimes been found before that anne even shes like she had been looking at the face of the right and did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes was hoped might be fulfilled and by that enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present for another disappointment her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontinuedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect where the her brain had complete my disappointment would be certain but here by carrying with the one sees her source of regret in my sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized a scheme of which general disappointment is only warded off by the defense of some little peculiar evokesation when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very mindlessly her mother but her letters were always long and very short those to her mother contained little else than that they were just too kind of a library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to be the first to be married and this is forster but they were going on to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learned for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public after the first four and three weeks of her absence they held for a few more and tearful she had to reappear at law and boy everything wore a happier aspect the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and some were finery and summer engagement arose mrs bennett was restored to her usual wireless serenity and by the middle of june kicks an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so taller and reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day a long time last by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be corduited marathon the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs gardner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent mr gardner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northwards than darbyshire in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs gardner it had a peculiarly strong attraction the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth don dale or the beauty the visit was excessively visit one she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time in time and all was soon right again with the mention of darbyshire there were many ideas connected it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner but surely said she i may enter his county without impunity and rub it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me the period of expectation was now doubled four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival but they did pass away and mr ed misses gardner with their four children did at length appear at longborn the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favorite and whose daddys sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them playing with them and loving them the gardeners stayed only one night at longborn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of not one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness of companions a suitableness which comprehended health and tempered to bear it is not the object of this work to give a description of darbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which theyre out there lay oxford plenum warwick camelworth birmingham etc are sufficiently known a small part of darbyshire is all the present concern to the little town of lampton the scene of mrs gardners former residents and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and in talking over there route the evening before mrs gardner expressed an inclination to see the place again mr gardner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approvation my love should you not like to see a place of which you have heard so much said her aunt a place too with which so many of your acquaintances are connected wickham passed all his youth there you know elizabeth was distressed she felt that she had no business in her body and was obliged to assume this inclination for seeing it she must own that she was tired of seeing great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains mrs gardner abused her stupidity if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful they have some of the finest woods in the country elizabeth said no more but her mind could not act reass the possibility of meeting mr darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred and would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run in such a risk but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavorably answered accordingly when she retired at night she asked for the chamber maid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family knew down for the summer a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms now being removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme to pemberley therefore they were to go end of chapter 42 chapter 43 elisabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter the park was very large and contained great variety of ground they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent elisabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminent where the wood sees situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound it was a large handsome stone building standing well in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance its banks were neither formal or falsely adorned elisabeth was delighted she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or her natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehension was taken on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elisabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder when her she was the housekeeper came a respectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had an enotion of finding her they followed her into the dining parlor it was a large wellpreportioned and some rounded up elisabeth after a slightly surveying went to a window to enjoy its prospect the hill crowned with wood which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as they passed into other rooms beauties to be seen the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor but elisabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither godly nor uselessly fine with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings and of this place thought she i might have been mistress with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but no recollecting herself that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite her this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something very like regret she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent but had not the courage for it id like my mother to move down by her uncle and she turned away with her im while mrs reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him to borrow with a large party of friends how rejoiced was elisabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day her aunt now called her to look at a picture she approached and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantle piece her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it the housekeeper came forward and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman the son of her late master stewart who had been brought up by him at his own expense he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild mrs gardener looked at her niece with a smile but elisabeth could not return it and that said mrs reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my master and very like him it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago i have heard much of your masters fine person said mrs gardener looking at the picture it is a handsome face but lizzie you can tell us whether it is like or not mrs reynolds respect for elisabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master does that young lady know mr darcy elisabeth colored and said a little and do you not think him a very handsome gentleman maam yes very handsome i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my late masters favorite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then he was very fond of this mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of ms darcy drawn when she was and is ms darcy as handsome as her brother mrs gardener oh yes the handsomeest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished she plays and sings all day long in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master she comes here tomorrow with him mr gardener whose manners were very easy and pleasant and courage to her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs reynolds either by pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and ms darcy is always down for the summer months except body was about when she goes to rams weight if your master would marry you might see more of him yes sir but i do not know when that would be i do not know who is good enough for him mr and mrs gardener smiled he was about could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so i say no more than the truth and everybody will say that no sin replied the other he was a best thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never known a crossword from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas that he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying there are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky in having such a master better but i have always observed that they who are goodnatured when children are goodnatured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the world he was a better most stared at her can this be mr darcy thought she his father was an excellent man said mrs gardener yes maam that he wasnt need and his son will be just like him just as afflomotivable to the fore this is the one you heard doubted and was impatient for more mrs reynolds could interest her on no other point she related the subjects of the pictures the diminishing rooms and the price of the furniture in vain mr gardener highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which she attributed her excessive commendation of her master so let again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase he is the best landlord and the best master who think of nothing but themselves there is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw anything of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men in what an amiable light does this place him body elizabeth this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behavior to our poor friend perhaps we might be deceived that is not very likely our authority was too good on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very fitting room lateness then the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done early he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walks towards one of the windows mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight when she should enter the room and this is always the way with him she added do for her the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms were all that remained to be shown in the former or many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance to mr darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at completion and returned to it again before they quit the gallery mrs reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers lifetime there was certainly at this moment and elizabeths mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance the commendation be stowed on him bubbleed and the praise of an intelligent servant as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship how much of everyones pain was in his power to be still how much of good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favorable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered it in her own and sought the lives in her pride of expression when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned it downstairs and taking leave of the housekeeper her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables they were within 20 yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of both were overspread with a deepest blush he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not the sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of her being right you were being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left longborn and of her having stayed in darbys shirt so often and in so hurried away as plainly spoke the distraction of his thought understanding a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave holy and grossed by her own feelings followed them in silence she was overpowered by shame and evacation her coming there was the most unfortunate the most illjudged thing in the world how strange it must appear to him in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come or why did he thus come a day before he was exiled but to speak with such civility to inquire after her family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had you spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think or how to account for it they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a noblur fall of ground oh oh oh oh its too which they were approaching but it was sometime before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy then was she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everything she was still dear to him perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself they entered the woods and bidding a due to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds when in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander where many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with a long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the street mr gardner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but stared at it might be beyond the walk with a triumphant smile they were told that it was 10 miles round it settled the matter in descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the gender there it was a smileless a story than any they had yet only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it he was about long to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs gardner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river oceldum able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much in getting the chance to see the sea about them that he advanced but little whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy approaching them and at no great distance the walk here being less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met elizabeth however astonished wasnt this far prepared why didnt you review it and before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if you really intended to meet them for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path the idea lasted while returning in the walk concealed him from their view and she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met who admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words — intruded and she fancy that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously confused her color changed and she said no more mrs gardner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honor of introducing him to her friends this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly surprise the child at his being now seeking people some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself what would be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a slide with him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such a disgraceful companions that he was surprised by the connection was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr gardner he was about to be pleased could not but triumph it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush she listened most attentively to all that past between them and glory in every expression every sentence of her uncle which mark is in intelligence his taste or his good manners the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighborhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport mrs gardner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth and her name for a look expressive of wonder elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment and continually was she repeating why is he so altered from what can it proceed it cant be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened my reproofs at huntsford could not work such a change as this it is impossible that he should still love me after walking sometime in this way the two ladies and front the two gentlemen behind unresuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant theyre chanced to be a little alteration it originated in mrs gardner who was fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husbands mr darcy took her place by her knees and they walked on together after a short silence the lady first spoke and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till tomorrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasions his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party was fully abandoned they were going to be early as mark he was in the end and among them our son who will claim an acquaintance with you mr bingley and his sisters he was about to enter the bus like that her thoughts were instantly driven by aaaaaa if she might judge by his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged there is also one other person in the party who are particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lampton the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she had seen it to me she immediately felt that whatever desire mr darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking far there it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her was it not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr and mrs gardner were half a quarter of a mile behind he then asked her to walk into the house at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward she wanted to talk but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject at last she recollected that she had been traveling and they talked of metlock and dovedale with great perseverance yet time and her ant moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before that tetatet was over on mr and mrs gardners coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with utmost politeness mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any of the ladies he is personally wellbehaved polite and on assuming said her uncle there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his heir and is not unbecoming i can now say with the housekeeper that those some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it i was never more surprised than by his behavior to us it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as we come or rather he has not wickens countenets for his features are perfectly good but how can you come you better be with so disagreeable he was about to do his yourself as well as he could said that she had liked him better when they had met in kent than before and that she was a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle you are great men off and are and therefore i shall not take him at his word as he might change his mind another day and warned me off his grounds he elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character but said nothing from what we have seen of him continued mrs gardner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel away by anybody as he has done by poor wickens he has not an illnatured look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks a there is something illegal to tell the truth that would not give for him evirable idea of his heart but to be sure the good lady who showed us his house did give him the most flaming character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behavior to wickum and therefore gave them to understand in as gardner the manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different room so amiable as they had been considered in hered for sure in confirmation of this she related the particulars about the two very transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might you be right mrs gardner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection as she was too much in the age and pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environments to think of anything else fatigue does she had been by the mornings walk they had no sooner dying than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfaction of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuents the occurrences of the day were two full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think a situation her to be appointed as a assistant read by kara schallenberg on december 17 2005 in oceanside california this is a libra vox recording all libra vox recordings are in the public domain for more information or to volunteer please visit libravoxorg this reading by mark bradford pride and prejudice by jane austen elizabeth had settled in the mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after there arrived at lampton these visitors came they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends the sound of a carriage drew them to windo and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a caracle driving up the street elizabeth immediately recognized in delivery guest or event if her to small degree of her surprise to her relations by equating them with the honor which she expected her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business nothing had ever suggested it before but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter then by supposing a partiality for their needs while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeths feelings was at every moment increasing she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded less the partiality of the brotherhood have said too much in her favor and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her she refuted from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down he gave her an adcomposer self saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself since her being at lampton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monocilable miss darcy was not a larger scale than elizabeth though little more than 16 her figure was formed and her appearance will mentally and graceful she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense in good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unemberased and observer as evermistered arcee had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings they had not long been together before miss darcy satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room all elizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any who could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which she expressed himself on seeing her again he inquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good humour to ease that he had ever done to mr and mrs gardner he was scarcely less interesting personage that to herself they had long wished to see him the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention the suspicions which had just a risen of mr darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love of the ladies sensations they remained a little endowed elizabeth on her side had much to do she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure to suggest for those to be she never to give pleasure or prepossessed in her favor bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh how ardently did she long to know whether or not she was she talked less than on former occasions and once her twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was tried to trace her resemblance but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behavior to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival to jane no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred in air they parted which in her anxious interpretation do you know to the recollection of jane not to ensure by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead you to the mention of her had he dared he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months what is this little whimper let her fall dancing together elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact in the afterwards vacation to ascure and unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at long board there was not much in the question nor in the preceding form she heard an accent so removed from hottier or disdain of his companions has convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however in any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in huntsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield were as dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so disastrous to please so free from selfconsequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance to these other things has been set to be discussed and the difficulty of the things that the questions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings their visitor stayed with it above half an hour and when they arose to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardner and miss bennett to dinner at pembroley before they left the country miss darcy though with a diphth in switchmarked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed mrs gardner looked at her niece desires of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head presuming however that this study to avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband gage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many inquiries to make after all her hurt for her friends elizabeth considering all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister when her visitor is left them keep a bowl of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction the while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little eager to be alone and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favorable opinion of bingley and then her into waiting to press but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardners curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her of mr darcy he was going all matter a bit exciting to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants from her she was known would not have recognized it for mr darcy there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lampton friends that could materially lessen its weight they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by an inhabitant small marital it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor with respect to wickham the traveler soon found his patron where imperfectly understood it was yet a wellknown fact that on his quitting derby shore he had left many debts behind him which mr darcy afterwards disjardged as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley the seafting more than the last and that evening though as it passed seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay away two whole hours endeavering to make them out she certainly did not hate him no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that it could be the respect for him by the shortterm value of allities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant stemony so highly in his favor and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced but above all above respected a steam there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked it was gratitude gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulence and accrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicant display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where there two selves only were concerned was eliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on the aid exciting not only astonishment but gratitude for to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means of pleasing though it could not be exactly defined she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself with her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece that such a striking civility as mr sees in coming to see them on the very day i felt it temporarily where she had reached its only to elate breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be the same as her and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pembrolee the following morning they were therefore to go elizabeth was pleased though it she after selfthe reason she had very little to say in reply mr gardener left them soon after breakfast the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting since the gentleman said temporarily chapter 45 convinced as elizabeth now was that ms bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how unwellcomfortable appearance that pembrolee must be and was curious to know how much— northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and a for beautiful notes and finishes just as much as ever before in this house they were received by ms darcy who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london her channels reception of them was very civil but attended with all— would easily give to those who felt the inferior the beliefs of her being found and reserved this is gardener and her niece however interjustice and pityed her being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments it was first broken by mrs anzley a gentle agreeable looking woman whos endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly wellbred than either of the others in between her and mrs hurst the case was open from elizabeth the conversation was carried on ms darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did denture a short sentence and there was least danger of its being heard elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by ms bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to ms darcy without calling her attention this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much her own thoughts were employing her she expected every moment that some of the gentleman would enter the room she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine after sitting in this matter a quarter of an hour without hearing ms bingleys face elizabeth was roused a cold inquiry a fuffer family she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the others said no more the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits its but this did not take place until after many a significant look and smile from mrs anzly to mr arce had been given to her minder of her post there is now employment for the whole party for that they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grape snektareens and peaches soon collected them round the table while this engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr arce but the feelings which were prevailed on his entry and then the put a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came he had been some time with mr gardener who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning with the ladies of the family and then the visit to her gen at that moment and the sooner did he appear that elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfect with these that was a huge great great great great were easily kept because she saw that this is visions of the whole party where a week end against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behavior when he first came into the room in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in this being leads in spite of the smiles which overspreet her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for to talk and though elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempted conversation on either side this beingly saw all this likewise and in the improvements of anger took the first opportunity of seeing with sneering civility pray misalisa are not the blank sure militia removed from meriton they must be a grace lost to your family in darcys presence she dared not mention we come as name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatureed attack she presumably answered the question in a total earthquake detached at all while she spoke an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcut with confusion and unequal lift of her thoughts hadness beingly known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have restrained her by bringing forth the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her but tray a sensibility which might injure her in darcys opinion and perhaps her mind elatter of all the follies and absurdities by which some were being repented not a syllable had ever reached her of as darcys meditated a loathement to know creature how did the nerve yield where secrecy was possible except to elizabeth and from all beinglys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from the very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming her after her own he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavor to separate him from misben it it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend elizabeths collected behavior and as misbingly next and disappointed dared not approach her to her to janaus and her brother we could speak any more her brother whose eyes she feared to meet scarcely recollect it her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage was beingly was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person behavior and dress but george anna would not join her her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favor his judgment could not air and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave george anna without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable when darcy returned to the saloon ms bingley could not help with the details of her foxy had been saying to his sister a very illnessalyze of benah looks this morning mr darcy shes afraid i never in my life saw anyone so much alter does she is since the winter she has grown so brown in course louise and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again however little mr darcy went and liked such an enormous he contented himself who would be replying that he perceived no other alteration than her bringing rather tanned no miraculous consequence of traveling in the summer for my own part george i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her her faces too thin her complexion has no brilliance and her features are not at all handsome her nose wants character theres nothing marked in its lines her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i could never see anything extraordinary in them they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air all together there was a selfsufficiency without fashion which is intolerable persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people when we first knew her in her furniture how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at another field she had been called another bit but where she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time yes replied darcy who could contain herself no longer but that was only when i first saw her for as many months since i visited her i could tell that the handsome was good on the flying he then went away and this big leap was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say would give no one any pain for herself this is gardner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both of the person who had mostly engaged their attention they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of everything himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardner thought of him and mrs gardner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject and of chapter 45 this is a librevox recording for more information art to volunteer please go to librevoxorg recorded by efaccurrit chapter 46 elizabeth had been a good deal to support it in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lamden and this to support it had been renewed on each of the morning in the lavas best pair but unprepared her repigning was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on a corner which was marked that it was a meaningless sentence and in the beginning elizabeth was a guest at the time as jane had written the direction remarkably ill they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves the one miscent must first be attended to it had been written five days ago the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written an evident agitation gave more important intelligence it was to this effect it was wise you didnt have to the thing has occurred of the most unexpected and serious nature but the only afraid of alarming youth the assured that we are all well what i have to say with the last place for kind of forester to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham imagine our surprise to pity however it does not seem so wholly unexpected im very very sorry so impudent to match on both sides but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood faultless and indiscriminate in peace but this is not let us rejoice in the future marks nothing bad at heart his choices disinterested at least for him must know my father can give her nothing our poor mother is sadly grieved my father bears it better how thankful i am that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves they were all of saturday night about 12 as this conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning a day they must have passed within 10 miles of us colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here lydia left a few lines for his wife in farming her of their intention i must conclude what i cannot be long for my poor mother i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i am i am scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth unfinished red as follows it has been written a day later than the conclusion of the f my hairy letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so devoted but i cannot answer for anything dear elizabeth i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed in the fruit and to the marriage between mr wicken and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place further is but too much reason to fear that are not gone to scotland colonel forster having left bright in the day before not many hours after the express though lydias short letter to mrs f gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w never intended to go there artillery lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off from being intending to trace their root he took the keys but no more for an entry in that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the shades that brought them from epsom all that is known after this that they were seen to continue the london road i know not what to think after making every postman quarry on that side london colonel f came on on it and hotfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through with the kindest concern that could happen to longboard its really great for him to misstep but no one could throw anything artistress my dear lizzie is very great my father and mother but i cannot think so ill of him im sorry i might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to everything impossible i grieve to find however that colonel f is not disposed to depend upon the marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w was not a man to be trusted my poor mother is really ill and to keep her room could she exert herself it would be better but this so affected poor kitty has anger for having concealed her attachment the most important thing is that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over i shall own that i long for your return i am so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient adieu i take up my panic and do what ive just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earn as the man i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again tomorrow evening in such an exigence my uncles advice and assistance would be everything in the world he will immediately comprehend the dynamics to feel and i rely upon his goodness oh where where is my uncle quietin is he is in a moment with the toy and some precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared her pale face and pictures are made of stard and we have made a new gift for himself to speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias situation hastenly explained i thank your pardon but i must leave you i must first call and ask him to the fathers and to the fathers still to lose good god what is the matter quietin i will not attain a minute but let me i let a servant go out you are not well enough elizabeth has indicated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless and accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master his household instantly on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her are to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill no i thank you she replied and devarine to recover herself there is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news that she is just too sweet she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word darcy in retchance suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern use it cannot be concealed from anyone my youngest sister has left all her friends has a load has still been yourself into the power of mr wicken they are gone off together from brighton you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that content him too she is lost forever darcy was fixed in a staunch night when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice the time i took her part of it only some part of what i learned to my own family how does god have to do with it i am grieved indeed crited darcy grieved shot but is it certain absolutely certain oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were supposed to almost abandon but not beyond they are certainly not gone to stop my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncles immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done how is such a man to be worked on how are they even to be discovered my wife not the smallest her it is everywhere horrible darcy shook his head inside hahaha when my eyes were empty i was like oh had i known what i ought what i dared to do but i knew not i was afraid of dont too much rretched dont rigid mistake darcy made no answer he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy elizabeth soon observed and ran slightly understrain her whole instinct everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of the calculated to make her understand her own wishes and to never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain but self though it would enthrote could not engrocer lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on the mold soon swallowed up every time and suffering her pain in her fine machine in this of a few years soon lost to everything else and after a pause of several minutes it was only recorded by the voice of her companion who in a matter which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise or strained said im afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i anything to plead and excuse my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that anything could even say or die on my point but might also consolation to such distress but i will torment you not with the vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i say that urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be long he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wish to the happier conclusion than there was a present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away as he quit at the room elizabeth felt having trouble with his affection for some of the other such distress of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in darbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties side at the perseverance of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuous and would formally have rejoiced its commemoration if gods children esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeths otherwise if regards bringing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural he has so often described as erasing on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defense except that she had given some ought to the trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that is ill success might perhaps authorized her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment be that as a day she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydias infirmate must produce she was also a star of the first pleasure of remained in her mind she was also a prize all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl who was impossible he could have remained in her mind she was all surprised all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl who met was impossible he could marry for money and her lydia could ever attach her but apply an incandemic principle but now it was all too natural for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an allopement without the intent of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding she had never perceived while the regiment was in hardfriture that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any sometimes worse sometimes another had been in favor she was the reason in her opinion her actions have continually been fluctuating but never would be object the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl oh how a cutely did she now feel it she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and required constant damage and though almost persuaded that nothing could have done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance until he entered the room her impatience was severe mr mrs gardner had heried back in alarm supposing by the servants account that there are neither she eagerly communicated the calls of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy though lydia had never been a favorite with them mr mrs gardner could not but be deeply afflicted not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of some prized horror mr gardner promised that every assistance in his power elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit every piece of the lateinthree journey is speedy surface they were to be offered seamless possible but what is to be done about pembame cried mrs gardner john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us was it so yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement that is all settled what is all settled repeat to the other and are there those adjournance as per her to disclose the real truth oh that i knew how it was but wishes were vain or at least could only serve to a user in the hurry and confusion of the following hour how did elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to once stop after others but she had to stop after others as well as her so the whole completed mr gardner meanwhile loving several things we dont be in nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed end of chapter 46 recording by e f f c this is a libravax recording all libravax recordings are in the public domain for more information or to volunteer please visit libravaxorg reading by any comment and sent loose misery on january 9th 2006 pride and prejudice by jane austen chapter 47 i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter to girl who was by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friend or not said her friend could he expect that he noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk do you really think so pride elizabeths writing up for a moment and my words mr gardner i begin to be a abur on this opinion deacency honor and interest for him to be guilty of i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself listen to so much more than you can up as to believe in capable of it not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case in the first place the final third argument there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland oh but they are removing from the shades into a hackney coach as such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnett road well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptional purpose there is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though lex expeditiously married in london than in scotland but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his men particularly friend you see by james account was persuaded of his neverintending to marry her lydia what attraction has she beyond youth health and good humor that can make him for her sake for go every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restrained the apprehensions of disgrace in the core might throw on a dishonorable elopement with her i am not able to judge is to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia from his indolence and a little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage it does seem and it is most shocking indeed reply to elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sister sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing it so she is very young she is a good person subjects and for the last half year nay for a 12 month she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the blank sheer were first quartered in mariton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head what shall i call it seceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of personal and interesting captivated woman but you see the jane said her on theres not things so very ill of wickham as to believe in capable of the attempt a film does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would think capable of such an attempt to let were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligated in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honor that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating and do you really know all this pride mrs gardiner whose curiosity as to the motor and television stard rc and do yourself when last at longborn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worthwhile to relate but his lies about the whole temporarily family are endless from what he said of miss darcy i was merely prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he must know that she was as in a moment of pretending as we have found her but what is the reason i dont know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the blank sheer was to leave mariton in a week or fortnight time as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i but it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to anyone that the good opinion which all the neighborhood had of him should then be overthrown but in her eyes to his character never occurred to me that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head that such a constant response thats been ensued you may easily believe was far enough for my thoughts when there all removed a bretton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had anything be thrown away when he first entered the core she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were every girl in or near mariton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him go away and others of the regiment he treated her with more distinction again became her favorites it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this impulse to some kind of fight or feeling of discussion no other could defend them from and wrong or the whole of the journey the trouble is a bit for the thoughts it was never absent fixed there by the keenest of all anger they traveled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping long night on the road reached longborn by dinner time in the next day it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been worried by longexplained the little gardeners attracted by the sight of rescinding on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first plea each of the maheasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane became running down from her mothers apartment immediately met her elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives not yet replied jane but now that my dear uncle is calm i hope everything will be well is my father in town yes he went on tuesday as i wrote to you word and have you heard from him often we have heard only twice he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly beg them to do and my mother how was she how are you all my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken she is upstairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all she does not yet leave her dressing but you how are you cried elizabeth you look pale how much you must have gone through her sister however assured her of being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears when they were all in the draw the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they said found that jane had no intelligence to be the same one who hoped of good however her sister been up on her heart to just say still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps and on their marriage mrs bennett to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage plaming everybody but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing if i had been able could she carry my point and going to brighten with her why did the fortress ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some pregnant collector on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing i was a little after i always thought they were very unfit to have a charge of her but i was overruled as i always am poor dear child and now heres mr bennett gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the collins is will turn us out before he is called in this grave and if he were not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardener after general assurances of his affection for her and would assist mr bennett in every endeavor for recovering lydia to not give way to useless alarm atty though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton and a few days more we may gain some news of them until we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to tell i shall put my brother and make him come home to give a very strict street and then we make himself together as to what is to be done oh my dear brother her partner has been it that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry and has for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia if she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them after they are married to stay that i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such trumblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such repeating is it heart i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrived it all but mr gardener though he assured her again of his earnest endeavors in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fear left her talking to her in this minute till the news on the table it all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busy engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before one came from her books and the other from her toilet the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favorite sister or the anger which she had herself in her business had given more of fretfulness than usual as for mary she was mr seen up and herself to whisper to elizabeth with accountants of grave reflection so you have to they were seated at table this is the most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talkative but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behavior towards the undeserving of the other sex elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them and the afternoon the two elder mispenning was made to be for half an hour by themselves elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all of its surfing and the spinnet could not assert to be fully impossible i have not already heard give me further particulars what does it look forced or say have they know every mention of anything before the elotment took place they must have seen them together forever colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydias side his behavior was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being on this coffin when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey and was then he convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of their intending to go off i couldnt force her seen any himself yes but one question by him denny denied knowing anything of their plans and would not give his real opinion about it he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before until colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained it out i suppose of their being really hmm i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sisters happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that i only felt how intuitive and match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last platter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks but not before they went to brighton wickham himself does he know his real character said he did not speak so well of wickham as he formally did he believed him to be impudent and extravagant and since the sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meriton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false oh jane had we been less secret how we told what we knew of him this could not have happened perhaps not matter or why theyre sister but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable films of lydias note to his wife he brought it with him for us to see jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth these were the contents my dear harriet you will live and he is a angel i should never be happy without him so think of no harm to be off you need not send them word at longborn of my going if you do not like it for well make the surprise the trainer when i write a letter inside my name lydia wickham hey my excuse is to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure i shall send for my clothes when i get to longborn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up goodbye give my love i hope you will drink your affectionate friend lydia bennett oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had finished it what a letter is this to be written at such a moment but at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side as she loved him my poor father how he must have felt it i never saw anyone so shocked he could not speak of words for fulltellions my mother was taken la mead and the whole house in such confusion oh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day i do not know i hope there was thats be guarded at such a time its very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavored to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took me from my faculties your attendance upon her has been too much for you you do not look well oh that i have been with you you have had every share and anxiety upon yourself alone my aunt kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours and clothes should not be put on my aunt kitty is not going to be put on day after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters they should be accused to us she had better have stayed at home pregnless a bit perhaps she meant well but after such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of ones neighbors a system is impossible condolence is sufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom a place where they last changed horses see the postilians and try to hide she got the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come with a fair form of mumbling and has he thought that the circumstances of a gentleman and a ladys removing her might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham if he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fair he determined to make inquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirit so greatly disconquered did i had difficulty and finding out even so much as this end of chapter 47 chapter 48 the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennett the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him his family knew him to be on all communications a most negligent and deletory course fondant but at such a time they had hoped for exertion they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain mr gardiner had only waited for the letters before he set off when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr bennett to return to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel mrs gardiner and his younger sister and her heart for cheer a few days longer as a former daughter present to my service of all two her nieces there are other aunt who visited them frequently and always as she said she never had some fresh instant of wickens extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more disputed than she found them all americans seem striving to blacken the men who but three months before they were also in danger of life he was declared to be in death a little of seduction had been extended into every tradesmens family everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and everybody began to find out that they had always disrupted the appearance of the women she did not believe enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come they must have all probability of having some news of them mr gardener left longborn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to grace church street that mr bennett had been absent and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr bennett thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings mr gardener himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to his system in pursuing it he added that mr bennett seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to right again very soon there was also a postscript to this effect i have written the colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young mens intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence at present we have nothing to guide us colonel forster will i dare say do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts perhaps lizzie could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person elizabeth was at no loss to understand from where this deference to her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory and nature as the complement deserved she had never heard of his having had any relations except the father and mother both of whom had been there in the blank sheer it might be able to give more information and though she was not fair every day at longborn was now a day of anxiety but the mothers letters was a grand object of every mornings impatience through letters whatever was to be there and they were there at her succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr collins which as jane had received directions opened all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiositys his letters always were looked over her and read it like wise it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condol with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under but which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hartfordshire be assured my dear sir that mrs collins the most absolutely sympathized with you and all your respectable family because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe it must be of all others the most affliction to a parents mind the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison to this and it is more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behavior in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at this time that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such any normity thats so early in age how so ever that may be you are grievously to be pitted in which opinion i am not paying for this is not that the likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related to you fair they agree with me and not prehending that this must happen in one daughter who made her face to the other for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family and this consideration leads me more over to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of less november for had it been otherwise i must have been in love and all your sorrow in this grace let me then advise you dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection forever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense i am dear sir et cetera et cetera et cetera mr gardiner did not write again until he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send it was not known that wiccup had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living his former acquaintances had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of disarray aiming debts behind him to a very considerable amount colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton the owed a good deal in town but his deaths of honor were still more formidable mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particular things j forth them heimster she cried this is wholly unexpected i had not an idea of mr gardiner added in his letter but they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavors he had yielded to his brother in lawson treaty he became a victim of the fear of facing justice to the advisable for continuing their pursuit when mrs bennett was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before what is he coming home and without who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and the children should go to london at the same time that mr bennett came from her the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey from all the perplexity about elizabeth and her darbyshear friend they had attended her from that part of the world his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs gardiner had formed of there being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing elizabeth had received none since her return mrs gardiners death was a renderdied mrs of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydias infamy somewhat better it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two when mr bennett arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophical composure he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it it was not till the afternoon when he had joined them at t that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then how quickly expressing herself what her but myself it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it you must not be too severe upon yourself reply to elizabeth you may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so prone to fall into it no lizzie let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame im not afraid of being overpowered by the impression it will pass away soon enough do you suppose them to be in london yes where else can they be so well concealed and lydia used to want to go to london had it to be she is wellbeing then said her father dryly and her residents there will probably be of some duration then after short silence he continued lizzie i bear you know ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shows some greatness of mind they were interrupted by miss bennett who came to fetch her mothers c this is a parade he cried which does one good youre such a liar im just talking to you another day i would you to say i will sit to my library in my nightcap and powdering down and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia you go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as you spawn for 50 pounds no kitty i have at least learned to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it no officers ever to enter into my house again not even to pass through the village falls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry well well said i will take you to a review at the end of them and of chapter 48 this is a librivox recording only brivox recorded here this is it librivox short oaks this recording is by the g by the g by jane austen two days after mr bennetts return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards some and concluding the children but instead of the expected something when they first heard she said to me its been a big problem for interrupting you but i was in the hopes you might have got some good news from time so i took a liberty of coming to ask what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from time do you imagine cried me to see and greatest on the human did you know there is an express come from master from mr gardner here has been here this half hour and masters had a letter away around the girls two eager to get in to have time for speech they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from the instaulter of the library so father was in neither and they were on the point of speaking about stairs to their mother when we were met by the first time he said if you are looking for my master mom he is walking towards the little cops upon his information they instantly passed through the hall once more and when across the lawn after their father he was deliberately pursuing his way towards the small wood on one side of the pattern jane he was not so loud and was saying much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out oh papa what news what news how did he not come here on the floor yes i have had a letter from him by express well and what news does it bring good so he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps he would like to eat it

am able to send you some tidings of my news and such as upon the hill a hope it will give you satisfaction soon after he left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london my world the particular sort of resolve told me to meet it is enough to know where he had discovered i have seen one base and in case i was out i might change i have seen them both they are not married no can i find there was any reason i would not have found any reason i would have found an engagement which i have been to make on yourself i hope it will not be long before there all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by 7th 30th of may 35000 families should be in london so in the end this is a game of lying hurt during life 100 pounds per annum these are conditions which considering everything i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you i shall send this by express that note my noble act for women and men you will easily come to mind from these particulars that mr wickens circumstances are not so helpful as they are generally believed to be the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will

set her sister my dear father congratulate you and have you answered the letter criter elizabeth no but it must be done soon most earnest did it she then intweety him to lose no more time before he wrote oma dear father she cried come back and write immediately consider her important every moment is in such a case let me write for you mr jane if you dislike the trouble yourself i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done and so saying he turned back with him and walked towards the house can they ask said elizabeth but the problems i suppose must be complied with complied with i am only ashamed of his asking say little and they must marry yet he is such a man yes yes they must marry there is nothing else to be done but there are two things that i want for and the other how am i ever to pay him one so i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight temptation as 100 years during my life and 50 after i am gone that is very true he said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before his text to be discharged and something still to remain i would must be my uncles doings jen was good man i am afraid he has to stress himself the small sum could not do all this and then mr jeff harder he was in the form of a terrible disarthing left in the house i should be sorry to think so he looked at me beginning of our relationship 10000 pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be became mr bennett made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reach the house their father then went on to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast room and they are really to be married quite elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves how strange this is and for this we are to be thankful so they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched and loose character we are thought to be jealous oh lydia i comfort myself i am so sorry that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her i dont call her something towards clearing him i cannot believe that a 10000 pounds or anything like it has been advanced here has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half 10000 pounds if we were ever able to learn that we can stay at the scene said elizabeth and how much is said that he said on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gordon has done for them because wikham has not experienced himself the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be required it they are taking her home and the fauding her their personal protection and kindness its such a sacrifice to her advantage and i do not know by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not ever mean for them now she will never do and we must endeavor to forget all that has passed on either side such a jane i hope in trust they will yet be happy this consenting to marry her is a key i will believe that he has come to a right way of thinking their mutual affection will steady them they are fond of her their condot has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor anybody can ever forget it is useless to talk of it it never came to go their mother was an all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it new to her he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied just as you please may we take my uncles letter to read to her take whatever you like and get away elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went upstairs together mary and kitty were both with mrs bennett one communication words therefore to her after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud mrs bennett could hardly contain herself as soon as jane had read mr gordon as hope of lydias being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance she was now in an invitation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and evokesation to know that her daughter would be married was enough she was left out by an aprior for her ability no humble but any remembrance of her misconduct my dear tip i shall see her again she will be married at 16 my good how alone to see her at the cd were come to but the clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister god note about them directly lizzie my dear run down to your father and ask him stay stay i will go myself ring the bell please i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet her eldest daughter endeavored to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her host to the obligations which mr gordon has been gave you a labour more london for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wicken with money well quite a mother it is all very great to it at her own uncle if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except if he was innocent she could not have stood in his room my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and you will write for me we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslim and cambreak and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait to her father was a leisure to be consulted one days delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate and usual other schemes too came into her head i will get married and such she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister phillips and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs long kitty ran down at all of the carriage and airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do anything for you and married and oh here comes hill my dear hill have you heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and usual all have a bowl of punch mrs hill began instantly to express her joy elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly to refute in her own room that she might think was freedom poor lydias situation must had best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be just the expected for her sister in looking back towards the head feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of

of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him he now wished it more than ever had he done his duty in that respect lydia and he not have been indented to her uncle for whatever of honor or credit could now be purchased for her the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place he was seriously concerned that a cause of his death has vanished and he should be forwarded at the soul experience of his terrible and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and of course mr bennett who married a calming was held to be perfectly useless four four four four some is a joy of cutting off the end a few two two two two two two two four four four four four four ive been serving that he would this event had at last been disparate of but it was then too late to be saving mrs bennett had no turn a little bit of love independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennett and the children but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter to pennied on the will of the parents this was one the majority of the living families which was now to be settled i mr bennett could have no hesitation in seeking to pitfalls the beforehand in terms of great applause mr bennett said that so its best most concisely he then delivered on paper oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no he would scarcely be 10 pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid for them four but with her board and popular allowance and the continual presence in london which passed your home oh no the existence of the criminal im going to let you go on its side two was another very welcome surprise for his wish at present was to have his little treble in the business as possible when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he not found the crime he had to find her in the business ive let her with soon dispatch four the utilitarian campaign came business he was quick in its execution he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was to angry ruby to send him it had been far more for the advantages of conversation had misplidia a senate come upon the town or as a happy assault turnative been secluded from the world in some distant farmhouse but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had preceded before from all the spiteful ladies and meritons lost with a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because of a such a husband her misery was considered certain its important that the citizens of the country had a retable and in spirits of pressively high no sentiment of shame gave a damn to try it the marriage of a daughter had been the first object of her wishes since she was a teenager and those attendants of elegant natural fine muslims new carriages and so on she was only 13 through the neighborhood her proper situation per day had changed without her parents she made a good decision to act in her own situation and she sent an important decision hey park might do such a if the goldings could quit it or if the great house had stoke if the drawing room were larger ash worth his daughter and while the servants remained but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs bennett for you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding into one house in this neighborhood they shall never have admittedly and courage in spirit longborn a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennett was firm it soon led to another and mrs bennett found with amazement in horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion mrs bennett could hardly comprehend it that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as her husband she was scared to receive value exceeded all she could believe possible she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters napsules than to any sense of shame at her lopping and living with wickeham a fortnight before they took place elizabeth was now hardly sorry that she had from the distress of the moment the lead to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage with so shortly give the proper termination to the loved one they might hope to conceal its unfavorable beginning from all those from that they may be amazement geno fear of its spreading farther through his means there were few people on who seek a sister or a more powerful opponent to punish but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of his sisters frailty but have mortified her as so much not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate the team would go to the past bowl between them had litties marriage included the most honorable terms it was not to be suppose that mr darcy would connect himself with the family where to every other objection but now be added in lines in relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned from such a connection she could not render the field train the wish of procuring her guard which she had assured herself of his feeling and dervisher could not an irrational expectation survived such a blow as this she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it she wanted to hear of him when there seemed to be least chance of gaining intelligence she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet but a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago when now have been most gladly and greatly received he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous she began knowing to come to him if hes exactly the man who in disposition and talents would you say hes understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes it was a union that must have been too much of a poach by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information a union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of other was soon to be formed and the same way he was he was a good man and he was a good man and he was a good man and he was a good man and he was a good man and precluding the possibility of other was soon to be formed in their family how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine but how little of permanent have he used to come to her who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture mr gardineras soon wrote again to mr bennetts acknowledgment he briefly replied but the assurance of his eagerness to promote the wealth for any of his family and concluded with the treaties that the subject might never be mentioned him again the principal pervert of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had dissolved on quitting the mission it was greatly my wish that you could do so patty as soon as his marriage was fixed and i think you will agree with him and considering the removal of that course i think thats what he was going to do and my thesis it is mr wickhams intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able to willing to assist him regiment now quartered in the north it has an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom your promise is fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent ive written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to be a quest that he will satisfy the various creditors and mr wickham in a nearcomputer thank you thank you for your time sir and believe give yourself a couple of parents and our surents as to his creditors in our town of whom my shalls have joined a list according to his information he has given in and all will be completed in a week they will then join his regimen and they are first invited to longborn and i understand from his gardener that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south she is well and begs to be due to play remember to you and your mother youre et cetera be gardener mr bennett and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removed work from sure thats clearly as mr gardener could do but mr bennett is a good girl for you witty of things that was in the morning just can she expect a most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan for the residing in her future but the severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regimen where she was acquainted with everyone and also her own favorite she is so fond of the swarster its a chain it will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she likes her the opposite of that is a pleasant pleasure his daughters request her such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of this sisters feelings and consequences that she should be noticed on a marriage by her parents erge tim so earnestly yet so rationally and so mild the thing as they thought and act as they wish and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighborhood before she was banished to the north when mr bennett wrote again to his brother and her daughter he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longburn elizabeth was surprised however that way comes she could consent to such a scheme she actually consulted only her own inclination and he meeting with him would have been the last honor the sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her properly more than she felt for herself the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to returnbrute and was blackened in the thought of what her sister must endure they came the family was s umbling in the breakfast room to receive them smiles decked the face of mrs bennett as a carriage drove up to the door her husband head because of her daughters off the door her daughters alarm conscious her man it was thrown open and she ran into the room her mother stepped forward and braised her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wikam who followed his lady and wished them both joy within a lack of a game which showed no doubt of their happiness his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips she was easy shirts but the buttons left her right hand this event was disgusting the bass wild noisy and fearless she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations a wet mump doll for all her friends this is the only round of room it took so to some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there wikam was not at all more stressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed to their relationship would have delighted them all elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she thought that that was all linked with himself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudence of an impudence of an impudence of an impudence of an impudence of an impudence she blush and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two cause are companions and self with no variation of color there was no warmth of course the bride and her mother neither of them talked fast enough and wikam who happened to sit near elizabeth began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighborhood but the good humor and ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies this seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world nothing of the past was recollected with pain only think of it as being three months she cried since i went away it seems that a fortmanideclare and yet there have been things enough happened at the time could gratious and i went away im sure im more near being married till i had come back though i thought it would be very good fun if i was her father looked at her a bizarre jane was distressed elizabeth looked expressly at lydia but she never heard nor saw anything of which she was people are about to know im married today i was afraid they might not and we overtook william golding in his perical so i was determined you should know it and so i let down the sideglass next to him and took out my glove and that my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring passing through the hall to the dining parlor she then joined them soon enough to see lydia she was not to be surprised at time with lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so holy free at first her ease and good spirits increased she longed to see mrs phillips locuses and all their other neighbors and to hear herself called mrs wickham by each of them in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring and boasts of being married to mrs hill and the two housemates well mama said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband is not yet charming man im sure my sisters must all envy me i only hope they have half my good luck they must all go to bright that is the place to get husband what a pity it is mama we did not all go i was very true and if i had my wife we should but my dear lydia i dont at all like youre going such a way off must it be so oh lord yes that is my sisters mama and my sisters im done im done im done i guess im ready there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for the mall i should like a deal on that i should never and then we go and then we went on two of us this was behind you and i did see a shot of a husbands body before the winter was over i thank you for my share of the favor settle his bed but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands the visitors were not to remain above ten days with them mr wakeham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of the fortnight no one but mrs bennett the bread is at home stay with us she made love so much im sorry the daughter and having very frequent parties at home these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circles even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry shes scared to leave im sorry im sorry im sorry but there are lovin have been brought on by the strength of her love rather than brought his and she had not served him that was a flight he was one who would have to be dressed in circumcassages that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion lydia was excessively fond of it he was her dear wakeham my never occasion no one wants to be put in competition with him he did everything best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september and anybody else in the country one morning soon after their arrival she was sitting with you two elder sister she said to elizabeth nizi i never gave you when account of my wedding i believe you were not by when i told mom and the others all about it are not you curious to hear out it was managed no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be two little setup subject now you are so strange but i must tell you how it went on and the others were to meet us at the church tell them to be quiet and came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and i should have gone quite distracted and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away this is as she was reading a sermon however i did not hear about one word in ten and i was thinking you may suppose of my dear record and to know what they could be married in a certain country yeah and so i left for certain as usual i thought it would never be over for who by the value at and to stand that my uncle and my poor and pleasant all the time i was with them and the only thing i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight not one party or ski or anything do you sure learn it in this rather than in but however the little theater was open well and so just as a carriage came to the door my uncle was called away from businessmen who had gone downstairs and then you know when once they got together there was no end of it well i was so frightened i did not know what to do from my uncle was to give me away and if he were beyond the hour we could not be married all day but luckily he came back again ten minutes time and the real setout however i recollected afterwards that if he had prevented going the wedding need not be put out from mr darcy might have done as well mr darcy you peed it loads a bit and had our amazement oh yes he was to come there with the window but the gracious me im quite forgot i had not to have said a word about it i promised them so faithfully what would wake him say it was to be such a secret if it was to be secret its a shame say not another word on the subject you made the pen upon my seeking no further oh certainly siddilizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions thank you siddilida for if you did but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information mr darcy had been at mr zwettling it was exactly this ah but though in gestures as to the meaning of rather than why courage into her brain but she was satisfied with none those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable she could not bear such a spree oh thats an explanation of what lydia had dropped if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended how a person is imagining with any of us and can have you speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time pray right instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think thats and then i must endeavor to be satisfied with ignorance not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter am i do rant if you do not tell me in an honorable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and strategums to find it out jane stelke at sonsavanna were not allowed to speak to elizabeth privately but lydia had let fall elizabeth was blood of it tell her to period whether her increase would receive any satisfaction shell rather be without a confident end of chapter 51 this is a librivox reporting all librivox recordings are in the public domain for more information visit librivoxorg recording by sherry crowther pride and prejudice by jane austin chapter 52 elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could she was no sooner in possession of it than herring into the little coax where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and looked at me happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial grace church street september 6 my dear niece i had just received your letter and shell devote this whole morning to answering it as i proceed that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you i must think i should stop the crime for your occupation i did not think that it was taken from you dont think that it was taken from you you know that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side if you do not too understand me forget my imprisonment this is not a surprise for you and nothing but the woman that is who are being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he is done but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit on the very day it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours welcome repeatedly lady of one from what i used to do he left darbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with a resolution of hunting for them the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wiggums worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to be the stake in pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to make his character was to speak for his character he told me that there was no step forward and never to remedy an evil which he had brought on by himself if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to fall there was some time ago governance to mr c and was dismissed from her car and caused a disappointment to not see what she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings mrs young was he knew intimately acquainted with wiggum and he went to her for intelligence of him from her what he wanted she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found wiggum and he had gone to her on her first arriving on monday and she had been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her at length however our kind friend will cure the worst for direction he saw wiggum in afterforfor the first time she was in the hospital liched had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and returned to her friends as soon as they could be prevented but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wiggum she was sure they should be married sometime or other and it did not much signify when since such were the things it only means he thought to secure an expedite marriage which in his very first conversation with wiggum he easily learned had never been his design he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honor which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydias flight on her own folly alone he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his situation he could protect her very living a family her sister at once though mr bennett was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by but he found him applied to this question that wiggum still cherished the hope of more effectively making his fortune by marriage in some other country under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief they met several times for there was much to be discussed wiggum of course wanted more than he could get but at length it was reduced to being reasonable everything being settled between them mr darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in grace church street the e she found on further inquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning he did not judge your father to be a person who he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former he did not leave his name until the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business on saturday he came again your father was gone your uncle at home at again on sunday and then i saw him too it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longborn but our visitor was very obstinate i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defective his character after all he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be faint therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole but at last your uncle was first to be aware and instead of being allowed to be of use to his knees was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rock him off his borne feathers and did the trees where it was due but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or keep done for the young people his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above it was only to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that what his character had not been understood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was perhaps there was some truth to this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys reserve can be answerable for the event but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in me affair when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money workers were then to receive the last finish you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure lydia came to us and would come head of highstackers and would have exactly what he did new him in heart for sure but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with the last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family if she had heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not list i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my doing mr darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding or thursday will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him his behavior to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in darbyshire his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he married prudently his wife may teach him i thought he was very slim he hardly ever mentioned your name but slimes seems the fashion pray forgive me if i have been very presumed or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from pemberley i shall never be quite happy to lie have been all around the park a lowfaiting with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing but i must write no more the children have been wanting me this half hour yours very sincerely and gardner the contents of this letter through a lisbon into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the great ashare the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters match which she had fear to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time her sister could drive her to the ground her proofed beyond their greatest extent to be true he had followed them purposely to tell he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meat frequent and finally the man who he was who was selfish to avoid and was very nim it was punishment to him to pronounce he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor a steam her heart did whisper that he had done it for soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on it used him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as the currents against relationship with wickham brother and love wickham every kind of pride must revolt from that connection he had to be sure done much she was ashamed to think how much but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal in doosman she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavors in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return oh she grieved over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him crowd that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again it was hardly enough for it to be still possible she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle have been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and her father she was proud of her concern so we thought she was a good person she was a proge and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken i should be sorry indeed if it were we were always good friends i do not know mrs bennett and lydia are going in the carriage to mariton and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley she replied in the affirmative i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much early or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the old husky brisepose poor reynolds she was always very fond of me but of course she did not mention my name to you yes she did and would it should say that you had gotten to the army and she was afraid and not turned out well at such a distance that you know things are strangely misrepresented certainly he replied biting his lips elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy and townmustsman we passed each other several times i wonder what he can be doing here perhaps preparing for his marriage with mr burr said elizabeth it must be something particular yes he introduced us to his sister and you like her very much i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within mr r2 when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very glad you liked her i hope she will turn out well i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age did you go by the village of kympton ive had a most delightful place excellent person at house the women of siddil knew him every respect how should you have liked making sermons exceedingly well i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not to repyne but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness but it was not to be did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left to you conditionally only and it will of the present patron you found a misunderstanding i dont want to be a stranger was it time when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been one of the biggest accordingly we are now almost at the door of the house fishing it walked fast to get rid of him thank you did not let a squirrel out of the past in future i hope we shall be out fashioned gallant the whole thing knew how to look mr mcmillan was so perfectly satisfied that his reputation that he loved introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him via it the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs bennett was forced to submit to a separation which has her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at the end of the year when shall we meet again oh lord i dont know not these two or three years perhaps right to me very often my dear as often as i can but you know mary women have never much time for writing my sisters may write to me they will have nothing else to do mr mcmillans goodbyes very much more affectionate than his wife he smiled looked handsome mr bennett as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw he simmers and sees me love to us all i am prodigiously proud of him the loss of her daughter made mrs bennett very dull for several days i often think that she that there is nothing so bad as partying with ones friends one seems so forlorn without them this is the consequence it must be better satisfied that your other daughters are single it is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is mary but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far but the spreadless condition which the cvt threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation the housekeeper at another field had received orders to prepare for the return of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks mrs bennett was quite in the fidgets she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns well well and so well so much the better not that i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again but however he is very welcome to come to another field if he is and he is what may happen but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it and so is it quit nichols was a marathon last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday she was going to the butcher she told me on purpose to order in some meals she has got plenty of food just fit to be killed miss bennett had not been able to hear of his coming without changing color it was many months since she had mentioned his name to a elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said i saw you look at me today lizzy when my aunt told us so the present report and i know i appeared distressed but dont imagine it was from any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see other peoples remarks elizabeth did not know what to make of it has she not seen him in darbyshire she might also come to him and come in there with no other view than what he was but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friends permission or being bold enough to come without it yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation i will leave him to himself in spite of what her sister did elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it they were more disturbed more unequalled than she had often seen them the subject which had been so warmly canvas between their parents about a 12 month ago was now brought forward again as soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear said mrs bennett he will have to wait on him of course no no you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand again his wife represented him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentleman on his return to another field tis an etiquette i despise said to him if he wants to sit in the queue he knows what he wants to do i may not spend my hours in running after my neighbors every time they go away and come back again they am determined we must have mrs long and the golden soon that will make 13 with our cells so there will be just room at table for him consult by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husbands insavility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbors might all see mr bingley in consequence of it before they did as the day is a lie i became extremely sorry that he comes at all and said to her sister it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference there means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says happy shall i be when his stay and another field is over i wish i could say anything to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a suffer is denied me because you have always so much mr bingley arrived mrs bennett the only successful students who tried to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before but on the third morning after his arrival in hartfordshire she saw him from her dressing room window enter the paddock and ride towards the house her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy jane recently kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mothers aunt she saw mr darcy with him and sat down again by her sister there is a gentleman with him mama sick kitty who can it be some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know ma replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with him before mr whats his name that tall proud man good gracious mr darcy and so it does i vow well any friend of mr bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very most sight of him she knew but little of their meeting in darbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which he must attend to her sister and she knew what he was supposed to do after receiving his explanatory letter both sisters were uncomfortable enough each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on after this likeremister darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only but elizabeth had sources of an easing in switch could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to show mrs gardners letter or to her sister and whose marriage she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longborn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behavior in darbyshire the color which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added luster to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken but she would not be secure let me first see how he behaves as she it will then be early enough for expectation she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected on the gentlemans with a propriety of behavior equally free from any symptom of resentment or a little too either as the ability would allow and sat down again to her work within egoness which it did not often come in she adventureged and her own plans have passed he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in her pressure than she had seen him at pemberley but perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed he was received by mrs bennett with a civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with a cold and ceremonious pardaliteness of her courtesy and address to his friend elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the first iteration of her favorite daughter from the illuminati of both infamy was heard and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied darcy after inquiring of her how mr mrs gardner did a question which she could not answer without confusion there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself but now several minutes he laps without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she is often found in the beginning as ever self and frequently on no object but the ground more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they had last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so could i expect it to be otherwise said she yet why did he come she was in no humor for conversation with anyone by himself and his hands she had hardly courage to inquired after his sister but could do no more it is a long time mr bringing since you went away said mrs bennett he readily agreed to it i began to be afraid you would never come back people did i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers it was in the times and the career i dont know if it was not enough to be it was only said it was late late george with them to miss many events without there being a syllable set of her father or the place where she lived or anything it was my brother gardener strung up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it did you see it bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations elizabeth did not look to surprise how much did she look to bear for she could not tell it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a doctor well married continued her mother but at the same time mr bingley it is very hard to be cassel a please quite not forget seems and they are to stay i do not know how long his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the militia he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves elizabeth who knew this to be loved it drew which nothing else had so effectively done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present a few weeks he lived when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and she has been ready as you please on mr bennetts manner i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such a vicious attention were the same fair prospect to arise that present as had flattered them a year ago everything she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexaceous conclusion at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself and men the first solution the heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such righteousness as this let me never see either one or the other again yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes it did though not quite so chatty jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever but her mind was so busy engaged that she did not always know when she was silent when the gentleman rose to go away mrs bennett was mindful of her intended days time you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley she added for when you went to town with the winter you promised to take a family dinner because the soon researched i have not forgotten you see and i am sure you are sure i was very disappointed bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business then they went away mrs bennett had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay in dining there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think anything less than two courses would be good enough for a man on whom she is with 10000 a year end of chapter 53 this is a liprovac recording all liprovac recordings are

they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must dead in them more mr darcys behavior astonished and vexed her why if he came only to be silent she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come hither if he no longer cares for me why silent teasing teasing man i will think no more about him her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister she said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance yes very indifferent indeed set elizabeth laughingly oh jane take care my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now i think you are in danger they did not see the gentle men again mrs bennett in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humor and common politeness of bingley and half an hours visit had revived on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longborn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas for bore to invite him to sit by herself on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided he placed himself by her elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looks towards his friend he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received a sanction to be happy that she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy with an expression of halflaffing alarm his behavior to her sister was such during dinner time as showed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that of looked only to himself janes happiness and his own would be speedily secured though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behavior it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humor mr darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them he was on one side of her mother she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how firmlooking cold was their manner whenever they did her mothers ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind and she would at times have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the business would not pass away without any an end and injuring the sense of humor or conversation then the mere ceremony of salutations attending his entrance anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemans she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up forever the gentleman came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but its a last beladys heck coffee and so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair and on the gentlemans approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the mens shant come in part us i am determined we went none of them to we darcy had walked away to another part of the room she followed him with her eyes and viewed everyone to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakest as a second proposal to the same woman there is no indignity so app orange today feelings she wasnt a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still yes she will remain there till christmas right to the have all of her friends left her mrs annously is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks he might have better success he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young ladies whispering to elizabeth again he walked away when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall evicted to her mothers capacity for waste players and in a few moments shes not pleasure they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself mrs bennett had designed before any of the others she had no opportunity of detaining them well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day i think everything has passed up on commonly well i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any eye ever saw the venison the soup was 50 times better than what we had at the lucass last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the purplages were remarkably well done and i suppose he is two or three french cooks at least and my dear jane i never saw you looking greater beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like him for the gistly this is bennett in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingleys behavior to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humor were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennett to elizabeth the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we may often meet again elizabeth smiled lizzy you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies me i assure you that i have now learned how to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of a dress and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man you are very beautiful send her sister how hard it is in some cases to be believed and how impossible in others but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge that is a question which i hardly know how to answer and all love to be struck so we can keep only what is not worth knowing forgive me and if you persist in indifference you are not making your calls at all chapter 54 this is a libravox recording all libravox recordings are in the public domain for more information or to volunteer please visit liprvoxorg reading by annie coleman in st louis missouri on january 16 2006 pride and prejudice by jane austen chapter 55 two few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits mrs bennett invited him to die with them i need to congratulate him you can get out of here you can get out of here next time you call said she at the time et cetera et cetera and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them can you come tomorrow yes he had no engagement at all for tomorrow and her invitation was accepted with a lacquerity he came and in such very good time that the lady none of them pressed in ran mrs bennett to her daughters room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out my dear jane make hasten her way down he is come mr bingley is come he is indeed i cast my cast here sarah come to miss bennett this moment and help her on with her gown never mind mrs lizzies hair we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went upstairs half an hour ago oh hang kitty what has she to do with it come be quick be quick where is your sash my dear but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening after tea mr bennett retired to the library as was his custom and mary went upstairs to her instrument two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs bennett sat looking and winking at a elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them elizabeth would not observe her what is the matter mama what do you keep winking at me for what am i to do nothing child nothing i did not win get you she then set still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and seemed to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her intrudity that she would not give into it in a few minutes mrs bennett half opened the door and called out whos the idea i want to speak with you elizabeth was forced to go we may as well deepen by themselves you know said her mother as she knew she was in the wall kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room elizabeth made her attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall to the then returned into the drawing room mrs bennetts schemes for this day were ineffectual bingley was everything that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter his ease and cheerfulness deepore with the ill judge a ficiousness of the mother and her all her silly remarks with her forebearance and command of countless particularly grateful to the daughter he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs bennetts means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband after this day jane said no more of her indifference not a word past two sisters and jingle but elizabeth went to bed and happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy returned within the stated time seriously however she felt terribly persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans concurrence bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennett spent the morning together as had been agreed on the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could prove his ridiculous negative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him bingley of course returned with him to the end right went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes but on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw her surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the heart as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this lead to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all their situation was awkward enough but hers she thought was still worse not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had set down suddenly rose and the noise to her sister ran out of the room jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world tis too much she added by far too much i do not deserve it why is not everybody as happy elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present i must go instantly to my mother she cried i would not on any accounts trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself he has gone to my father already oh let me to know what i have to wait will give such pleasure to all my dear friends the way to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting upstairs with kitty elizabeth who was left by herself now smile now her purity and ease with which nfair was finally settled that i given them so many previous months of suspense in a eviction and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious circumstance of all his sisters falsehood and the dryness the happiest wisest most reasonable end in a few minutes she was joined by bingly whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose where is your sister said he hastily as he opened the door with my mother upstairs she will be down in a moment i dare say he then shut the door and coming up to her elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his— for basis the excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition of jane in the general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of ms bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation for her face bennet could not give her consent or speak her apparition in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingly of nothing else for half an hour and when mr bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was not a word however past his lips and illusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane— jane— are a good girl you replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled i have not a doubt of you doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved done so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income and so or thoughtlessness and money matters would be unpartentable in me exceed their income my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are you talking of why me has four or five thousand a year and very likely more then addressing her daughter oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember soon as ever i saw him when he first came into heart for chair last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together oh he is the handsomeest young man that ever was seen wicken lydia were all forgotten jane was beyond competition her favorite child at that moment she cared for no other her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense mary petitioned for the use of the library at another field and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter bingley from this time as of course a daily visitor at longborn unless when some barbarous neighbor who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept elisabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else that must sometimes occur in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elisabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constant that she won evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town less spring i had now believed it possible i suspected as much to ben and sisters doing they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other that is the most unforgiving speech st elizabeth that i ever heard you uttered good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again the tube of miss bingleys pretended regard which you believe at lizzie that when he went to town less november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have preventing his coming down again he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty this naturally introduced a panagyric from jane on his dividends and the little value he put on his own good qualities elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous impression part in the world she knew it was a circumstance searching less than virginity is her against him i am certainly the most urgent creature that ever existed cry jane oh lizzie why are we in this family if i could but see you as happy if there were but such another man forgive me if you were to give me 40 such men i could never be so happy as you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happy no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time if you love this hero mrs ben was privileged to whisper into mrs phillips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her n his family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for miss fortune end of chapter 55 this is a library of oxford quarting hello dear please visit libprovoxorg pride and prejudice by jane austen chapter 56 one morning i bought a week after a week together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a page and they perceived a chase and forward driving up the lawn it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbors the horses were post as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed a missbinit to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him to the shrubbery they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued and they were little satisfaction they were of course on 10bit surprise but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of missbinit and kitty that she was perfectly unnamed to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt she entered the room with an air more than usually underraceous no other reply to elizabeths citation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance they never questioned her introduction missbinit all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly too elizabeth i hope you are wellmissbinit that ladyship is your mother elizabeth replied very cumflustered and that is the most stubborn sisters yes minam said missbinit delighted to speak to lady catherine shes the youngest brother the youngest brother and im just to somewhere about the grounds walking with the young man who i believe was soon become a part of the family you have a very small park here return lady catherine i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than st william likus this misleadiness in pregnant sitting under the evening of summer the windows are fullbassed mrs pinit assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mrs collins well yes very well i saw them the right for last elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable letter for her calling but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled mrs pinit with a great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating anything and then rising up said to elizabeth miss pinit there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness if you will favor me with your company go my dear cried her mother im sure really to ship her back to different walks i think shell be pleased with her my tinge elizabeth abandoned and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest downstairs as they passed to the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlor and drying room and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rounds walked on her carriage remained the door and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it they proceeded in silence and grabbed a lock at the window to the coos elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable how could i ever think her like her nephew said she as she looked into her face as soon as they entered the coos lady catherine began in the following manner your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come elizabeth unaffected a staunch man indeed youre mistaken but i have not been able at all to account for the honour of seeing you here miss bennett replied her lady ship in angry town you want to know that im not to be tripled with but however in sincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so my character has been ever celebrated for a sincerity in friendliness and in a cause of such moments as this i shall certainly not depart from it that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennett would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my mother i knew that this was a skin and this was a false law i would not enter him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off the truth that i make make my sentiments knit if you believed that impossible to be true that elizabeth coloring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble to confess that what could you believe to propose at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted youre coming to longburn to see me and my family as itll elizabeth cooly will rather be a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is an existence if do you then pretend to be ignorant of it has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves do you not know that such a reported spread abroad i never heard of this and can you like whats prepared for those who are not interested in more how do you know what prepared for this last year oh oh oh satisfied has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage your ladyship has declared it to be impossible it ought to be so it must be so while he retains a use of his reason but your art and allurments may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family you may have drawn him into it if i have i shall be the last person to confess it miss bennett do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such language as this i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and im entitled to know all his dearest concerns but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviors this ever induce me to be explicit let me be rightly understood this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place no never only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me lady catherine has a peculiar car from your infancy they have been intended for each other it was the favorite wish of his mothers as well as hers while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by young woman of inferior birth of no importance to the world and wholly unaligned to the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends to his tacit engagement with mr burr have you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy have you not heard me say that from its earliest hours he was destined for his cousin yes and ive heard it before but what does that to mean if there was no other objection and knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry mr burr you both knew as much as you could in planning the marriage its completion depended on others if mr dyssey is neither by honor nor inclination confining his cousin why is he not to make another choice and if i am not choice why may i not accept it because honor decorum prudents name interest for bidit yes mr bidit interest not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you willfully act against the inclination you will be centered sided and despised by everyone connected with him your lines will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any others mr burr said that he was not a judge she could upon the whole have no cause is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that score let us sit down you are to understand mr bennett but i came here with a determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor would i be disappointed i have not been used to say to any persons whims i have not been in the habit of booking disappointment but i will have no effect on me i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the fathers from respectable honorable and ancient though untitled families they are destined ha ha the way im stuck with tension is this to be endured but it must not shall not be if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit this fear in which you have been brought up in marrying your nephew i should not consider this hmm hey whats your mother hey and to nuncles hey im not an option to be settle this a bit if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you tell me at once for all are you engaged to him though elizabeth would not further mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moments delivery ah lady catherine seemed pleased and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement im shocked in a astonished i expect to find a more reasonable young woman but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever receive i shall not go away to you giving me the insurance out of the matter and i certainly ah i am not a good man i am good anythings so early unreasonable your lady ship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wish to promise make their marriage at all more probable supposed to be a true with my refusing to accept his hand and wish to bestow it on his cousin allow me to stay in lady catherine but the argument with which you have supported this extraordinary application had been as frivolous as the application was illjouched you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions these but you must certainly have no right to concern yourself in mind i must beg therefore to be impretuned no father on the subject thats the hasty if you please i have by no means done to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add i am no stranger to the particulars of your younger sisters needs i know a boy the young mans marrying her was a patched up business at the expense of your father and uncles and is such a girl to be my nephews sister is her husband the son of his late fathers steward to be his brother heaven and earth of what are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted you can now have nothing further to say she was then fully answered you havent salted me possible weapon i must beg to return to the house and she rose as she spoke lady catherine rose also and they turned back monitor and credit of my nephew unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you was disgrace him in the eyes of everybody lady catherine i have nothing further to say you know my son i have said no i am only resolved to act in that manner which well in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any of you you refuse then to oblige me your fuse to obey the claims of duty on earth you are determined to ruin your friends and make him the contempt of the world neither duty nor honor nor gratitude reply to elizabeth have any possible he my marriage with mr darse and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the squand and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i still know how to act do not imagine this been a that your ambition will ever be gratified i came to turn i hope thats reasonable but depend on it i will carry my point i were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i shall take no leave of you miss bennett i send no compliments to your mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displaced elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked wildly into it herself she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself she did not choose it said her daughter she would go she is a very finelooking woman and her calling here was progisiuss civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the columns as well she was on her road somewhere a dare say and so passing through mariton thought she might as well call in you i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzie elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible end of chapter 56 chapter 57 the discomposure of spirits which is extraordinary could not be easy overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than inscessantly lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rossis for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy it was a rational scheme to be sure from what the reports that they are engaged with her to me elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding he would everybody eager for another to supply the idea the sister was pregnant more frequently today and we made a split this marriage but for through their communication with the colonns as the report she concluded at rich catherine id only set that down as almost certainly but she had looked forward to as possible at some future time in revolving lady catherines expressions however she did not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in the center of yours what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must mediate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his dad he was the only one who had uttered such a bad idea and of a certain that in the new marinating the miseries of a marriage with one he could decide with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak in ridiculous contained much good sense in solid reasoning if he had been wavering before us to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intrudet of so near relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity could unblunished could make him in that case he would return no more lady catherine might see him in her way through and his engagement to bingly of coming against another field must give way if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his bed within 15 years i shall know how to understand i shall then give over every expectation that every wish is caused if he has satisfied his family regretting me when he might have obtained my functions in hand i shall say he used to regret him at all the surprise of the rest of the family unhearing who the visitor had been was very great but they ablagingly satisfied him with the same kind of supposition which had appeased misbendant curiosity and spare the visit to the muchteasing centre the next morning as she said the next morning she was not my father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand lady said hey i was going to the field come and to my room she followed him in there and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the time she had to be in some manner connected with the letter he held it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations she followed her father to the fireplace and they both sat down he then sat i have received a letter this morning thats astonished me exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents i do not know but i do not know i do not know im glad youre there very important conquest the color now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneously she was undetermined whether must be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather too addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious young ladies have a great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer this letter is from mr something very much to the purpose of this here begins with congratulations on the approaching of jewels of my eldest daughter ive wish it seems he has been told by some of the goodnatured gossiping looguses i shall not support with your impatience by reading what he says on that point what relates to yourself is as follows having this offered you the sincerest congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advised by the same authority your daughter elizabeth it is perceived well not long be having him with bennett after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in the land can you possibly guess lizzie is meant by this this shall be the best in a peculiar way with everything the heart of a moral can most desire splendid property noble candidate an extensible personages yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself a what evils you may incur by a personages which will be taken immediately adventure shall have you any ideas for this chance liz oh no listen to your question lady catherine deboe does not look on the match with the friendly eye mr dorsey you see is the man now lizzie i think i have surprised you could he or the locuses have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectively to what they were laid in mr dorsey who never looks at a woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life it is admirable lizzie thats trying to join her fathers pleasant journey i could only force one years words shell little agree about to her are you not toverted are you not toverted oh yes paradele after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her lady ship last night she immediately with an usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became a gift then in the score of some form of objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble and myer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage that has not been properly sanctioned mr collins moreover adds i am truly rejoice that my cousin lydias sad business has been so well hushed up and im only concerned that theyre living together before marriage took place should be so generally known i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement and hearing that she received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married it was an encouragement of vice and then ive been the director of longburn i should very strongly have a person you want certainly to forgive them oh thats a question oh thats a question oh thats a question for gives its a question for gives and his expectation of a woman all of her marriage but lizzie you did not look as if you enjoyed it you were not going to be a musician i hope and pretend to be a frontit i dont know i dont know for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbors and to laugh at them in our own turn oh im excited about it but it is so strange yes thats right that is what makes it amusing how they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your point of dislike may get so delightfully absurd much as i abominate writing i would not go we have about mr collins letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wicker as much as i value the impudence in hypocrisy and myself in law and pray lizzie lets send lady catherine about this she crawled to a police reconcent to this question his data replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear but they were not it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried her father had most cruelly mortals instead of his sing too little she might have fancy too much end of chapter 57

annie coleman in st louis missouri in january 2006 pride and prejudice by jane aust chapter 58 instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth have expected mr bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longborn before many days had passed after lady catherines visit the gentleman arrived early and before mrs bennett had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane posed their all walking out it was agreed to mrs bennett was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them together very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same they walked towards flucuses because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said mr darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampleed kindness to my poor sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how greatfully i feel it where it known to the rest of the family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy an atonement of surprise and emotion could you have ever been informed of what may an amistic in light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted you must not blame my aunt lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest until i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them to the other inducements which let me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever i am not a good man now force yourself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to wish he eluded has to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently loved he was supposed to be im a little bit of a fan able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffuse over his face he came in but as she could not look she could listen and he told her a feelings which in perfect much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects she soon learned that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and they relate returning to london its motto in the substance of her conversation elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the bleak thats such a relation must assist her endeavors to obtain that the ship its effect had been exactly contrary wise it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decidedly and elizabeth colored in laughter as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple and abusing you to all your relations what did you say of me that i did not deserve for until your accusations were illfounded formed on mistaken powers the various trooper it was unparadable i cannot think of it without a warrant the conduct of nine of the strictly examined will be irreproachable since then we have both i have improved in civility myself whats the best my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me youll reproof so well applied as shell never forget had you behaved in a more gentle and like manner those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me but with some time i confessed before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression i had not the smallest idea of there being ever felt in such a way i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me oh did not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do with all that im sure you and i have long been raised to part of each shame of it darcy mentioned his letter did it said he did it soon make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter im in the power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but that we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself i think no more id rather for more than that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten thats learned so of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the coin your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of innocence but with me it is not so principal as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately and only son for many years and only child i was spoiled by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amicable allowed encouraged impulse taught me to be selfish and overbearing to get for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from 8 to 8 and 20 and such i might still have been but for you dearest lovely as to elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my attention were the you being pleased i do then persuaded yourself that i should indeed i had what will you think of my vanity i believe false but not intentionally i assure you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong how you must have hated me after that evening hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger suddenly began to evaporate over me im almost afraid of asking be greater than mine and be a notice by you i conscience told me that i deserved to be a extraordinary witness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more my object then replied darcy to show you by every stability in my power and i was not so mean as you were meant to be passed and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that you have heard that im done how soon any of the wishes and traditions that i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you he then told her of georgianas to lighten her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learned that his resolution of following her from darbys future had been formed before he quit at the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had a risen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther after watching several miles in a visually manner and too busy to know anything about it i found it last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home the discussion of their affairs darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend when i went away i felt that it would soon happen that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much and though he exclaimed at the turn she found that it had been pretty much the case on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference means affairs absurd and impartinent the surprise was great i told him moreover that i believed my sons and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together elizabeth cannot help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely for my information less spring from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made here im reassuring to him that i suppose carried immediate conviction to him it did english is most of the fact that he did not insist his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious the case but his reliance on mine made everything easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded less to no longer than he remained in any doubt of his true selfdefense he has partly forgiven me now elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at and it was rather too and it was a secret that he was a secret of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation until they reached the house in the hall they parted end of chapter 58 this is a liberal vox recording all liberal vox recordings are in the public domain from more information or to volunteer please visit libervoxorg recorded by annie coleman in st louis missouri in january 2006 pride and prejudice by jane austen chapter 59 the dear lizzy what can you have been wanting to was a question which elizabeth received from jane as she knew she entered their room and from all the others when they sat down to the table she had only to say and reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge shed rather than she spoke than i knew that nor anything else awakened to suspicion and truth the evening passed quietly unmarked by anything extraordinary the acknowledged lovers talked and lied and in which happiness overflows in birth and elizabeth agitated for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away at night she opened her heart to jane those suspicion was very far from miss bennetts general habits she was absolutely engaged in mr darcy no no you shall not deceive me i know it to be impossible indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth hes still lovely jane looked at her doubtingly oh lizzie i cannot be i know how much you dislike him you know nothing of the matter that is all to be forgotten perhaps i did not always love him so much this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself miss bennett still looked all amazement elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth could happen can it really be so i miss now i must leave you i jane i deert there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world but are you pleased jane shall you like to have such a brother very very much nothing could get as an answer do you really love him quite well enough oh lizzie do anything rather than marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you what do you mean why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley im fringy will be angry my dearest sister now be serious i want to talk very seriously let me know everything that i am to know without delay will you tell me how long you have loved him it has been coming on so gradually but i hardly know when it began but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley another intrudi that she would be serious however produced by sarah and factor but she soon said that i was so weird for her im not sure its not attachment when convinced on that article miss benin had nothing further to wish now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself i always had a value for me i wish for nothing but a love of you i must always have a statement but now as bingleys friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me but lizzie you have been very slie very reserved with me how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lampton i owe all that i know of it to another not to you elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydias marriage all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation good gracious cried mrs benin as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr garza thats coming here again the valour dear bingley what can you mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here i had no notion but he would go atto shooting or something or are there enough to stirp us with his company what shall we do with him lizzie you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys way elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud this has been it have you known more means here about in which lizzie managed to weigh again today im a guys mr garza and missy and missy so im just a finish walk to ocomount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr garza has never seen the view it may do very well for the others were blind bingley but im sure it will be too much for kitty want to kitty kitty owned that she had rather stay at home garzas professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently attempted as she went upstairs to get ready missys been in trouble saying all i saw was that she could be close to her that she could be able to hide all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it it is all for janes sake you know and theres no occasion for talking to him except just now and then so do not put yourself to inconvenience during their walk it was resolved that mr bennetts consent should be asked in the course of the evening elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her appearance of the man but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally illadapted to do credit to her sons and she could no more bear that mr garza should hear the for trapsures of her joy than the first vehement of her disappropriation mr garza he rides also in callum and her agitation on seeing it was extreme and a year of her fathers position was going to be made up happy and that it should be through her means that she his favorite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr garza appeared again when looking at him she was a little bit of a mess go to your father he wants you in the library she was gone directly her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious have not you always hated him how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr garza or in other words you are determined to have him he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine characters than jane but will they make you happy have you any other object and youre relieved of my indifference tim i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly speaking of him in such terms lizzy said her father i have given him my consent he is the kind of myth i now give it to you if you are resolved and having him but let me advise you to think better of it i know your disposition lizzy i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior your lively talents would place you in the green steent in misery my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months of suspense and a new maridine with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match while my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say if this be the case he deserves me to complete the favorable impression she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia he heard her with astonishment this is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did everything made up the match gave the money paid the fellows debts and got him his commission so much the better it will save me a world of trouble and economy had it been your uncles doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way as she offered to pay him tomorrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before but he was reading mr thomass letter and after laughing if any young men come for mary orkitty send them in for im quite a deletcher elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure everything with two recent brigades the evening passed frankly away there was no longer anything material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennett said quite still and unable to utter a syllable nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backwards to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless her though good gracious lord bless me

you must and shall be married by a special license but my dear is so tell me what did mr darcys particularly fond of that i may have it tomorrow this was a sad omin of what her mothers behavior to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wishable luckily stood in such awe of her intended soninlaw that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention more mark her death for his opinion elizabeth had the satisfaction of

professions of regard jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew she deserved the joy which mr darcy expressed on receiving similar information was its sincere as her brothers in sending it four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight any answer could arrive from mr collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longborn family heard that the collins is for coming themselves to lucas lodge that attack may have been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away to the storm was blown over at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth but

complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their allmeeting frequently at st jamess with very decent composure if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight mrs phillips is out here so he was another thats a right or a text on his forbearance annomass phillips as well as her sister stood in too much of him to speak with a familiarity which bingleys good humor encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be bolder norm was her respect for him though it made her more quiet and all likely to make her more elegant elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship

marriage where all that was affectionate and insincere she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliant the joy which mr darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brothers in sending it four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and her earnest desire being loved by her sister before any answer could arrive from mr collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longborn family heard that the collins is for coming themselves to look as large the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away to the storm was blown over at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought and of secrecy of her husband he bore it however with admirable calmness you could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st jamess with very decent composure if he did shrug his shoulders it was not to sir william was out of sight mrs phillipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs phillips as well as her sister stood in too much of him to speak with a familiarity which bingleys good humoring courage norm was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant no is ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with him he might converge without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley end of chapter 60 chapter 61 happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennett got rid of her two most deserving daughters with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingly and talked of mrs darcy maybe guessed i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire and the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy and effect as to make her sense the most capable well informed woman in the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity and so unusual reform which she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly mr bennett missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him off toner from home than anything else could do he delightedly went to pemberley especially when he was least expected mr bingly and jane remained in leather field only at 12 months so near a vicinity to her mother and maryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affection at heart the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought in a state in a neighboring county to darbys share and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within 30 miles of each other kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters in society so superior to what she had generally known as great she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she became by proper attention and management mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily crying for a few different accomplishments by mrs bennets very quite unable to sit alone eyes over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparison between her sisters beauty and her own who was suspected by her father as she submitted to the change without much reluctance as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become a quaintine known to her and in spite of everything was not fully without hope the darcy might not buy himself such a hope was cherished the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us boyd money enough to live upon without some help any place would do of about three or four hundred years what for were doing not speak to mr darcy about it if you had rather not yours etc as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavored in her answer to put an end to every intrudy and expectation of the kind such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy and her own private expenses she frequently sent that it had always been evident to her that such an income is theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they change their borders either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home there was one set of the next dream there were always moving from place to place in quest of achieved situation and always spending more than they ought his affection for her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer her marriage had given her though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeths sake he assisted him further in his profession lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the binglies they both of them frequently stayed so long that even binglies could humor was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone miss bingley was very deeply mortified but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropped all her resentment was fondered than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as here to for and paid off every a rear of civility and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see they were able to love each other even as well as they intended georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she opened a act which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent a line to so very extremely specially elizabeth i am all intercourse was at an end but at length by elizabeths persuasion he was prevailed onto overlooked the offense and seek a reconciliation and after a little further resistance from the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on the macamorally in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and her from the city with the garden she was always on the most empty were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into our mixture had been the means of uniting them end of chapter 61 and of pride and prejudice by jane austin
