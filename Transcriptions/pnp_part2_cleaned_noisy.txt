 this is a livervance recording all livervance recordings are in the public domain the more information or development here visit livervanceorg prime intentions of the supreme court chapter 31 colonel fitzroyans manners were very much divided at the parsecaries and the ladies off the hook and must act considerate to the pleasures of their engagements at their residence in some days however before they received any invitation liver we wanted visitors in the house and they could not feel it and it was not to be triggered almost a week after the gentlemans arrival they thought they were honored by such an attention and then they were in the air and he was in the church to come down the evening through the last week they seemed very little already half of the head of the body colonel fitzroyan had called with the person who had more than once found the time but mr dresy had heard of the missing attention the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper extent they joined the program and ready to make things going for the ladies who received the silver thread it was clearly fair conferred by knowing so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was always in fact almost enveloped by the nephews speaking to them especially with regards to it much more than to any other person in the room colonel fitzroyan seemed really glad to see them anything was involved in the least of him at residence and mrs collins is pretty thin had more of a cognizancy there in the office he now seated himself by her and talks so agreeably at the pentpicture of traveling and staying at home of new books and music but the mr bethagver had been trapped so well in between the matter and before and they conversed so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady packer herself as well as of mr dresy his eyes had been soon repeatedly trained but the look of curiosity and thats a lady ship after the while shared the feeling is more openly acknowledged but she did not speak to call out what is that you were saying fitzroyan what is it you were talking about what are you talking about fitzroyan did i make him wanna do theres thinking of a minute fitzroyan when your longer age is a huge word for thought but the music has been crazy people out it is of all subjects my delight i must have my share and the conversation for speaking to you music now if you think you were in real life because you have more to do in dormant music than myself all of the natural taste if all i ever learned was really good is to wake the vision im so would add and if her help in the love of her to apply im confident that she would have performed in life for me how does she want to get on dancing mr darius please go pick a session at the table and you can speak to me im very glad you were such a good at how hard she is and hey tell her to me that she cannot expect to accelerate she does not have to succeed i assure you madden who you are fine but she does not need such advice she practices very constantly so much to better it cannot be done to your motion when im explaining her i shall try to not neglect it on any account i often tell young ladies that no excellent music is to be acquired without constant factors ive told miss bennett several times that she will never play real well unless she practices more and then mrs collins has their instrument she is very welcome as i have acted for her to come to rosem every day im play on the piano for her and mrs jenkins in the room she would be a nobodys way you know and that part of the house mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts bill of breeding and made no answer when coffee was over colonel fitzwillie reminded the elizabeth of helving promise to play to her and she sat down directly to the instrument he drew a chair near her lady catherine listened to half a song and then topped as before to her other nephew to the latter walked away from her and making his usual deliberation towards the piano for her the station himself so as to command a whole view of the fair performers confidence elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an archslile and said do you mean to frighten mr darcy and make all of this state to hear me i will not be alarmed by your sister does play so well there is a stubbornness about me that never can dare to interpret the little others my career has always arrived every attempt to intimidate me i shall let say you are mistaken because you could not be in the league to entertain any design of a learning game and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in a cage to make the best of your opinions which are in fact not your own elizabeth laughed her to leave this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwillie you are cousin would give you a very pretty note to your gaze and she should not forget elizabeth i said to stick with you unwarkly meeting with a person so able to expose my real character in a part of the world why i hope to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy i did very undenirously news and mentioned all the news who like disadvantaged and hurt creature and give me a leave to say very inpolicy for its provoking need or retaliate and such things may come out as well shock your relations to hear im not afraid of you he said smile and smile were here let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwillie i should let you know how you behave in a stranger well you shall hear that but prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time you had ever seen you must be over the ball and ill say fall what do you think he did he danced only for dances though gentle and rescares sent him my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in one to the partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact i had not at that time the honor of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ballroom well for no fits william what do i play next my fingers wait your orders perhaps sir darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but im ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers shall we ask your cousin a reason of this said a whist of it still a dozen colonel fitzwillie shall we ask him a flyamatter sense in education whos lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers well i can answer your question sir patone without applying to him because he will not give himself the trouble i certainly have not the talent which some people possess sir darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns without offensive done my fingers sir elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do they have not the same force of rapidity and do not produce the same expression but they might have always supposed it to be my own fault because i will not take the trouble of the fact of saying it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other womans superior execution darcys smile and said you are perfectly right you who employed your time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting we neither have us performed to strangers here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of elizabeth immediately began playing again lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy you miss been it would not by all of this because she practiced more i could have the advantage of the london master she has a very good her fingers are changing you could pay for it they are not equal to him and would it be the light that the former had her help allowed her to learn elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he had sent it to his cousins praise but neither at that moment nor did any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behavior to mr board she derived this comfort from his being late that he might have been just as likely to know her that she been his reaction lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing them with many instructions on execution and faith or does it have received the moment before darcys civility and at their request of the gentleman remained at the instrument to her lady ships turn and was ready to take the wrong moment end of chapter 31

calling to the real ive got one business into the village but you start by reading the door the serving city of the visitor as she has heard the old carriage she thought it looked a wise can feel a little capitol and on that apprehension of putting away her halfpitched letter that she might have escaped from her third letter the leader and her very very high used to dont say that those in the hands of the girl he seemed to think you made him so young that the tinha to speak enough andd it be for a mother and theного möglichkeiten distribution by cherlých right here hesمرly and a competitor the river gings the same territory as that of her isnt that so malay and 1p on the floor doctor and when they get despice theyre top two from her first death that was a tenest son and they didnt have a certain arrogance and why the hell i think he is too old what he would say and hes not just a bad taste but hes a good hes a good perfect hes suddenly in the age of the same energy blackhead under the bed of the darkness but must have been a must have been real as a wise thing so hes the thing to see all of him in some serious two times a flat white he went from a taste experience he and his sister were well i hope when he was lonely 30 years ago but i was he found a piece to see the lower the lower but i was the short so i think i think he would have understood that he was the feeling that he would have not had a feeling that he would have had a feeling that he would have never heard of ive never heard hes say but if its probable until later than dead he could have just turned down in the future he has many things and hes at a time of life when flames and engagements are continually increasing if he means to be about to be killed never fear if it would be better for the neighbour who should give up the place in time but then we went possibly get a circle coming there but perhaps we should have been that they didnt want to take the house so much that we can do it to the neighbour thats what hes doing and we must expect him to keep it or could it on the same thing i should not be surprised if he would give it off if he is any eligible person and if he would have made no idea he would have made a terrible long and strange and having nothing else to say but now the killing is the trouble of finding such a thing he took me and walked around and threw me down there and he just seemed very comfortable yeah lady catherine i believe with great fears i know that im not going to find her i believe she did and sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object mr collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife this indeed his friend may well know that his wife is a good person he may have a good choice and he is having met with one of the very few sense of honour who have accepted or may he have the best of her my friend has an excellent understanding one not certain of us are going to have her marry with the colours of the more isus he seems to have a good personality however and in a good way the character is certainly very good match for her it must be done we are very vulnerable to her but she started with a very serious very serious could you understand that im an internal girl and she does robin hood to sehen out her own feelings and she does her darling old as he spoke in short of smile which on his back fangs he killed the spirit he must be supposedly ready to take him a jay and never be out and she blushed as she asked her i do not mean to say that a woman may not be said it to her friend the fatherly man must be wiser and depend on name then circumstances wherever it is important mens speech is suddenly unimportant this is because he is no evil but thats not true mr and mrs collins have a comfortable name come but not so good one is wellalive threepoint journeys and i persuaded my friend not for the same year family underless than part mr darcy will be a chair and a partner and said you cannot have a right to start from very strong load that would you cannot have a boss being a normal and this would look surprised he felt the spirit and the change of fear he blew back fire to the young mans level and blastly over it said in a cold of voice i plead with kent the short violent and subject of the country is here i will wait to cite the harm and peace out and soon put an end to anybody in terms of charlotte and her sister just returned from the her war the tetatect surprised them mr darcy related them to stake which an occasion is including on miss bennett and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody when its away what can be the meaning of this at charlotte soon as he was called my dear a loser he must be in love with you or he would never call me a loser but go you listen to what i said it did not come to the end even the child in the past but after terrys funeral they could have lost a youth but they could have lost a youth it was the war

nor was there any revival of cast occurrences or any communication of heavy suffer but you all and then almost every line of food there was a lot of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize their style and which was sitting from the serenity of a mind that eases with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone he had been scarcely ever clouded he was about to notice every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first peruse of mr darcy shamed fullboast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister sufferings it was some consolation to think that his visit to rossings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she showed herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but arnold was going and made it clear that he had no intention of it off and a reallife was she did not need to be unhappy about while suddenly miss quake she was suddenly down by the sound of the doorbell and her spirits were a little closer to the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam mitoch who had once been called late in the evening and might now come to inspire particularly after her but this idea is needed and her spirit is very good for me at first when he heard other unnamed shes on the street artsy walk into the room in a very manner he immediately began an inquiry after her help impusing his visits to a rich security event she answered him told to go he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room he looked about what surprised but said not a word after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began in vain i have struggled it will not do my feelings will not be repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you elizabeths astonishingness was beyond expression she stared colored doubting and was silent this he considered sufficient encouragement and the of our all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more close to the truth than a close his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination or dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the components of such a mans affection and though her intention did not vary she was at first sorry for the pain you had to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent magnitude she lost all compassion in anger she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done he concluded with her presenting to her the strength of that attachment which he was quite involved in encounters he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favorable answer he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the color rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express the sense of obligation for the sentiments about however unefficient they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly been stowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasions pain to anyone it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope louis f horterace the feeling which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgement of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation mr darcy who was leaning against the mans peace with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every future he was struggling for the appearance of composer and would not open his lips to the belief himself to have a secret the cause of the same is a bad feeling dreadful at length with a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honor of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavor and stability i am not rejected but it is of small importance i am i as well in choir reply she why with so evident a desire of a feminine and a so different you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character theres not this some excuse for instability if i was unsyveled but i have other provocations no i have had not my feelings decided against you had they did the appointment or had they even did favour me do you think that any consideration would tend to be a secondofman who has been the means of ruining the path forever the heaviness of a most in love sister as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed color but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you have to bear you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for capris and instability and the other to its division for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the accused kind she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse he even looked at her with a smile of affected and crudulity can you deny that you have done it she repeated was assumed tranquility even reply i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my face from your sister or that i endured my wrong path to her to her to her to him i have been kinder than towards myself look at that disdain the appearance of noticing this similar reflection but its mean and did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate him but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is found it one before it had taken place my attenement of you was decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you hear defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you hear and pose upon others you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened color who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously yes this misfortune has been great indeed and of your inflection pride elizabeth with energy you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his dessert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule and this cried darcy and she walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully my fault according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps at a key stopping in his walk and turning the war turtleneck these offenses might have been overlooked had not your pride in first by my honest confession of the scribbles that had long prevented my forming any serious design these as you may have been surprised had i with greater policy concealed my struggle and flatter you into the belief of my being in hell but unqualified unalloyed in collenation by reason by recession by ambition but disguise of every source of my appearance nor am i ashamed of the feelings that related they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own it was the best felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost this is the closure when she said you are mistaken mr darky if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way then as it spared the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behave in a more gentle and micmanor she saw him start at this but he said nothing you could not have maybe offered up your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it again has astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled in creduity and mortification she went on from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfishness dain for the feelings of others were such as to form the groundwork of this affirmation on which succeeding events have built so immovable i dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness and with these words he hastily left the room and he lives above her in the next moment opened the front door and quit the house the two more brothers remind was now painful and great she knew not how to support herself and from acting with this set down and crying for half an hour first punishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr dock that he should have been in love with her for so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her inside of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and who must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously to draw me back but his pride to the vulnerable pride his shameless resolve of sudden head down with respect to change his arms are more apparent than actuality so he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wycomt his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited she continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of the babys pattern so he named her to allow her sister to go as far as found as subtle observation and hurried her away to her room and of chapter 34 chapter 35 elizabeth also works the next morning to the same thought and meditation which had at length close to eye she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of anything else and totally in this pose for employment she resolved to master breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise she was proceeding directly to her favorite walk when the recollection of mr darcys sometimes coming mass stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led farther from the turntight road the park pailing was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground after walking towards three times along that park its a rain she was tempted by the closeness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verner of the early trees she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr darcy she was directly retreating but the person who had advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards the gate he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of hotly composure i have been walking in the grove sometime in the hope of meeting you well need to immediately honor our reading that letter and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity he was about to open the letter and to her still increasing wonder to see if an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand the envelope itself was likewise full pursuing her way along the lane she then began it was dated from rosy at a to clock in the morning and was as follows the inaugural arm matters on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you i write without any intention of painting you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must have paid should have been spared had not in my character required it to be written and read you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feeling i know will be still it unwillingly but i demanded of your justice two offenses of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mention was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honor and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr wickham willfully and once in one to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favor of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence then on our patronage and who had been brought up to a special exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally distilled affecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in the future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read if in the explanation of them which in due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry the necessity must be obeyed and further apology would be absurd i had not been long and hurt for sure before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling of serious attachment i had often seen him in love before at that ball while i had the honor of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas accidental information that bingley is attention to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided from that moment i observed my friends behavior attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for misvenant was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him your sister i also watched her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of regard and i remained convinced from the evening scrutiny that though she received his attention with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment this year has not been the same yet i must have been an error your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict tear on her your resentment has not been unreasonable but i shall not screw fool to a servant that the serenity of your sisters countenance and error was such as my test given the most acute observable a conviction that however amy and bo are tempered for heart was not like a serenity and retouch that i was desired thus believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial convictions as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great and evil to my friend as to me but there were other causes of repudence causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavored to forget because they were not immediately before me these causes must be stated though briefly the situation of your mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly be trade by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father pardon me it pains me to offend you but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relatives and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the likesensher is praised unless generally bestowed on you and your elder sister then it is honoured to the sense and disposition of both i will only say that from what passed that evening my opinion all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection he left another field for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning the part which i acted is now to be explained his sisters unasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidences were feeling was soon discovered and a likesensable that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of thinking out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice i described and enforced them earnestly but however this roman stance might have staggered or delay his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately prevent the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance that i hesitated not having of your sisters different had before we would have turned to return his affection with sincere if with equal regard but bingley has great natural modest with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own sucan was there for that he had deceived himself but no very difficult time to persuade him against returning into hurt for sure when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment i cannot blame myself for having done much there is but one part of my conduct is whole affair on which i do not reflect the satisfaction it is that i convented to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it that they might have met without ill consequences perhaps probable but his guard did not appear to me nothing changed but him to see her without some danger perhaps this settlement this ties was beneath me this is done however and it was done for the best on the subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to art if i have room for sisters things it was unknowingly fun and though the motives which governs me you very naturally appear insufficient i have yet learned to condemn them with respect to the other more wavy accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only refuse it begging before you the whole of his connection with my family oh but he is quite clearly accused me i am your head but of the truth of this story i can summon more than one with a vindicated veracity mr wickham is the most very respectable man at the time many bears the management of all the pemberliest states and who is good enough in the discharge of his trust naturally inclaimed my father to be a divist him and on george wickham who was got some misleadness there deliberately bestowed my father supported him at school and afterward came bridge most important assistance to his own father always for from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentlemans education my father was not only fun he was young man society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him as for myself it has many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner the vicious propensity the one that was principal which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man at nearly the same age with himself and he had also of the unguarded moments which mr darcy could not here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character it adds even another motive my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desire that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant there was also a legacy of £1000 his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the performance by which he could not be benefited he had some intention he added of studying law and i must be aware that the interest of £1000 would be a very insufficient support for it i rather wished than believe him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to exceed his proposal i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman the business was therefore soon settled he resigned all claim to assistance in the church where it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return 3000 pounds all connection between us seemed now dissolved i thought too ill of him to invite him to temporarily or admit his society in town in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretense and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idolness and dissipation for about three years i heard live a look at him but on the deceased of the incumbents of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the prison his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it or exceedingly bad he had found the law a most untrothable study and was now absolutely resolved on being a game if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions he will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this intriguing or for resisting every repetition to it his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violence and his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped how he lived i know not but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice i must now mention a certain stance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the peasant could induce me to unfold to any human being having said thus much i feel no doubt of your safety my sister who is more than 10 years my junior was left to the garden in chicago my mothers nephew colonel fitzgulium and myself about a year ago he was taken from school and established a woman for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presides over it to downstairs and did their also went to listen undoubtedly by the mind for their food she has been a higher acquaintance between him and miss yon and whose character we were most unhappy to see and by her husband and a who so far recommended himself to georgiana whos affectionate part retain the strong impression of her kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to bereave herself in love and to consent to any loatmets she was then but 15 which must be her excuse and after stating her impudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the end can be looked and then georgiana unable to support the idea of breathing and offending a brother who she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole new man as in what i felt and how i acted regarding for my sisters credit and feelings he then today public exposure but i wrote mr winkham who left the place immediately and miss yon was of course removed from her child mr winkhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is 30000 pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenge itself on me was a strong and beautiful because revenge would have been complete indeed this that um is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope a quick and henceforth a pill of poor and poor i know not in what manner under what form a falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered that ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed for the truth of everything here related i cannot appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our nearrelationship and constant infancy and still more as one of the exact tutors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions if your importance of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him for a shallow and delicate find some opportunity of putting his letter in your hands in the course of the morning i will

information on how to volunteer please visit libriboxorg recording by sherry crowther pride and prejudice by jane austen chapter 36 if elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to continue renewal with his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents but such as they were it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrary of emotion they excited for feelings that she read were scarcely to be defined with amazing did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal with a strong prejudice against everything he might say she began his account of what had happened at another field she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes his belief of her sisters in sensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice he expressed his belief that what he had done which satisfied her his style was not hinting but thought he it was all pride in his feelings but when this subject was succeeded by his account of his joquette when she read with somewhat clear attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which poor soul alarming and affinity to his own history against self per feelings for yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition astonishment apprehension and even poorer of pastures she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly explain this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehood and when she had gone through the whole letter those scaredfully knowing anything of the letter to the truth but it feasts to be a way because thats focusing that she would not regard it that she would never look at it again in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying ferusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had released itself and the kindness of the lord mr garcin though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she was called for fairy words he was impossible to feel for fairys grossed to placate on one side or the other and for a few moments she flooded herself that her wishes did not air but when she read and rewed with the closest attention the particular immediately followed of wickhams residing all contingents of the living of his receding in new so considerable of some as £3000 again she was forced to hesitate she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success on both sides it was only a assertion again she read on but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had been indebted in possible that in contrivens could so represent as tarendra missed it rcs conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which was completely entirely harmless throughout the board the extravagance and general publicacy which he scrupled not to lay at mr wickhams charge exceedingly shot her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shah of mimlisha in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance of his former way of life nothing had been known in hardfeature but wickham told himself as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of inquiring his countenance voice and manner had established a map once in the possession of every virtue she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attack of mr darcy or at least by the predominant of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she could endeavour to class what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years opinion but no such recollection would be friended her she could see him instantly before her in every charm of error and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighborhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess after pausing on this point a considerable while she wants more attention to me but a last the story which followed as his designs are starting to sink we seek some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwalium and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwalium himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no reason to question at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr hardercy would never have hazarded such a proposal he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr philips many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wonder it had escaped her before she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward its here done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct she remembered that he had both did of having no fear of seeing mr hardercy that mr hardercy must leave the country but that he should stand his crown yet he had avoided the neverheal balls of their next key she remembered also that till the neverheal family had put it the country he had told the story to no one but herself but that after the removal it had been everywhere discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr garcys character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the sun how differently did everything now appear in that he was concerned his attention to his king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp anything his behavior to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his sanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most in caution for the show every lingering struggle in his favor grew a painter and painter and in further justification mr garcy she could not put a lounge in the prison when questioned the dream had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that prowd and repulsed as what his manners she had never in the full force of their acquaintance and acquaintance which had later be brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust anything that spoke him of earreligious or immoral habits that among his own connections he was a scheme and valued that even william had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had already read and spoke so affectionately of his sister as the proof him provable of some emiable feeling that had his actions been what mr wickham represented them so gross of violation of everything right could hardly have been seen above the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an annual demand of mr bingham worked in temperconservable she grew absolutely ashamed of herself of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without trying she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd how despicablely i have acted she cried i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcys explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again why the different was the effect of the second perusal how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one of the things that she had been obliged to figure out together he declared himself to be totaled in unsuspicious of her sisters attachment and she could not help remembering what charlets a payment had always been neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane she felt that janes feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her affair and manner not often he rented with great sensibility when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet married to reproach her sense of shame was simply the justice of the tribe struck her too fastfully for denial and the circumstances to which you particularly alluded as having passed as the number three call and is confirmed all this first and third could not have made a storm and question her with mine been on her the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelc it seemed but it could not consolver for the contempt which had thus been selfattracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be heard by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known given wing to every bride you thought reconsidering events determining how the bill of yours and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important the tea in a recollection of the long pieces made her at length with her home and she entered the house with the wish of her very true and unusual and the resolution of the present such reflections as an ostamil for unficture conversation she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosins had each call to her absence mr garsey only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found elizabeth could but just affect concern in the city she really did go to her home to tell her that all of her own daughter was injured she could have been on the throne record and of chapter 36 chapter 37 the two gentlemen left rosins the next morning and mr garseys having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisances was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in a tolerable spirit as the previous after the marvellous killing so lately gone through at rosins the rosins he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter in our history turn brought back with great satisfaction and message from her leadership importing that she self herself so dull as to make her very desired of having them all to dying with her elizabeth could not see the character with the opportunity for her to be found she might find this time have been presented to her as her future niece and i could she think that by the smile of what her lady ships indignation would have been what would she have said how would she have behaved with questions with which she and mr south the first subject was the delimitial of rosins i assure you i feel exceedingly said lady catherine i believe no one feels the loss of friends as much as i do but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are the dear crown rallied to spirits turn or grute till just that last but darcy seemed to feel it more acutely i think the last year his attachment to rosins certainly increases mr collins had a compliment and illusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter lady catherine was sick and couldnt let her stand on her spirit and he nearly counted for it by herself by surprise of her children well home again so soon she added but if that is the case you must write to your mother and bag that you may stay a little longer mrs collins will be very glad of your company i am sure i am much obliged to your lady ship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it i must be in town next saturday why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks i expected to you to stay two months i told mrs collins so before you came there can be no occasion when you are going so soon mrs bennett could certainly spare you for another four night but my father cannot he wrote last week to hurry my return oh dear father for some spare you with your mother can daughter may have saved my childrens spirit father and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going here early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the brooch box there will be very good room for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large you are all kindness maam but i believe you must abide by our original plan lady catherine seemed resign mrs collins must send a servant for them you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women traveling postdance it is highly improper you must be tried to send somebody i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing the young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life when my niece dr jim and wait to ask a last summer i made a point of having two men circumschooled her mr see the dior mr dior see a movie could not have been here with propriety in a different manner i am excessively attentive to all those things you must send john the young reggies response i implanted a clergymans commitment for it would be indeed discreditable to you to let them go alone my uncle was to send a servant for us oh youre uncle he keeps a mans servant as he i am very glad you have somebody who fits the pieces where shall i enter his house oh wrongly of course if you mention my name at the belt you will be a chandelier too maybe catherine had many other questions to ask for expecting her journey and as she did not answer them all herself a tenchanger as it said which elizabeth will need to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was reflection must be reserved for solitary hours when a person was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a gay went by without a solitary bump in which she might indulge in all the delight of unclosing recollections mr dior sees letter she was in a fair way of soon known by heart she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times wideened to her which she remembered the style of the

is gravely we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connections with rosins the frequent means of varying the humble home soon i think we may thought her ourselves but we are convinced that we could not have been entirely successful our situation with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which view can boast you see on what a fitting we are you see how continually we are engaged there in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble personage i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion while they are shares of our intimacy this is a great honor for us for insufficient consideration of his feelings and he was obliged to walk above the room while a little bit tried to unite civility and truth in a fear of short sentences you may in fact carry a very favorable report of us into heart for sure my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so lady catherines great attention to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of and all together i trusted does not appear that your friend has drawn and unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent only letting me assure you my dear elizabeth that i can for my heart most cordially abwish you equal to the city in marriage my dear charlotte and i have put one mind and one way of thinking there is then everything in most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us in syntia in the dark red carpet elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equals and serity could add that she shurper and relived and rejoiced in his domestic comforts she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang poor charlotte it was melancholy to leave her to such society that she had chosen with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion her home and her house keeping her pair and her fourstring and all her different groups in syntia had not yet lost their charms at length the chase arrived the transfer fastened on the process placed within and it was pronounced to be ready after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriagebrainister collins and as they walked down the garden of these conditions with his best perspective all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at lombrand in the garden and his fathers name is garde and ed he then handed her in her eyeopped and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some common words that bring air to the two confrontants of the any messages for the lady that rose in but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and carriagetrowed off good gracious cried mariah after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since they were keen and yet how many things have happened we have died nine times at losing besides drinking tea and quite a much of some aftertell elizabeth added pride to me and how much i shall have to conceal the journey was performed without much conversation or any in the four hours of the day of the hospital they had reached and needed to guard yourselves where they were to remain if you gaze jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits and its the various engagements which have been kindness of her and her and her reserve for them but jane was to go home with her and at lombrand there would be leisure enough for observation it was not without an effort that she could wait even for long before she told her sister of mr darcys proposals to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonishing and must at the same time so highly gratifying whatever of her own then she had not yet been able to raise it away it was such a temptation to open and as nothing could have been conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of which she remained and repaired if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into the city of something of danger which might only bring her sister further end of chapter 38 chapter 39 it was the second weekend may in which the three young ladies set out together from grace church street for the time and for the church and as they drew near the approved east largest event its carriage was to meet them they couldnt proceed in total the performance of duality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dying room upstairs these two girls had been up and hour in the place definitely employed visiting and up a certain number watch my video for a bit of an interesting faceality in the cover after welcoming their sisters they try and could be displayed in tables that are not as much as they could be explaining is this not nice is not this an agreeable surprise and we need to treat you all bad at lydia but you must let us the one we probably have just spent hours of the shock out there then show what her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unpinsurrent oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i had bought some prettier colored satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what one wears the summer after the militia have left meriton and they are going in a fortnight are they indeed creditless with great satisfaction they are going to be happy and i do so walk a thought to take this there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme and i do say with cost hardly anything a mile would like to go to of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall have yes mama elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once good having bright and cold cancels soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the front wall of the mansion now i have got some news for you the video as they sat down at the table what do you think it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person we all like jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told hed need not stay lidian laughed and said i that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the waiter must not hear as he can care i dared say he often hears worse things said than what i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am glad he is gone i never saw such a wrong churning my life well but now for my news it is above dear wickel too good for the waiter is it not there is no danger of wickels marrying mary king theres for you he is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay look at his safe and mary king is safe out of elizabeth safe from a connection included as to fortune she is a great fool for going away if she liked him but i am sure there is no strong attachment on either side century i am sure there is not a hint i will answer for it never cared three straws about her who could what such a nasty little fr�p thing elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such courseness of expression herself the courseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had harbored and fancy liberal as soon as all had ate and the elder ones pay the carriage was ordered and had the son and five and the poor party was all their bosses and the unclosed militia of the 80s and the 80s and the 80s purchases were seated in it how nicely we are all trapped in this right area i am glad i bought my bond and if it is only for the front of having another bandbox well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home and in the first place let us hear what it has she was all since she run away how do you see me my cousin man how do you have any flirting i was in great hopes that wouldnt you would have got a husband married back jane would be quite an old maid soon i declare she is almost 23 lord how a shame that should be of not being married before 23 my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you cant think she says lizzie had better of taking mr paulins and i do not think everyone has been in fun in it lord how i should like to be married before i need you and then i would cast her own view above the hall of all here in me we had such a good piece of fun the other day at her paulster the 80 and me were just been the day there and mrs paulster promised to have a little fans in the evening by the bottom of the foster me are such friends and so she asked the two herringers to come but harriet was killed and so ten was close to come by her and start and then what do you think we did we dressed up change remains in womens clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun not a soul new of it but carl and mrs paulster and kitty and me except my aunt where we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when danny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs foster i thought i should have died and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter with such kinds of histories of her parties and good jokes to lydia assisted by kittys innocent editions and never to amuse her companions all the way to longborn elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of her temper the reception at home was most common mrs bennett rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than one string dinner did mr bennett say voluntary tool elizabeth i am glad you are back lizzy the party in the dining room was large for almost all the visits to the woman who arrived and here the news in various were the subjects that occupied them lady memphis was inquiring of mariah after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs bennett was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present passions from jane who sat way below her and on the other we tailing them all to the younger lukuses and lydia and her voice louder than any other person was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her oh mary sit she i wish you a fun with us her we had such fun as we went along pity and i drew up the blind and pretended there was nobody in the podium and i should have gone so all the way it can be the nothing and when we thought to the george i knew things we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest fold lunch in the world and you if you would have thought we would have treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never should have gone into the poultry i was ready to die of laughter the men we were so married all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that anybody might have heard us 10 miles off to this mary very grateful that finds far the advantage of the new ideas is to start to depreciate such pleasures they would doubt this be congenial with the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms for me i should infinitely prefer a book but all of this answer lydia heard not a word she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute and never attended to mary in the afternoon lydia was urging the rest of the girls to walk in her agenda and to see how everybody would call her but elizabeths schedule opposed the scene it should not be said that the misvenants could not be home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officer there was another reason to prepare opposition she credits seeing the struggle come in and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible the comfort to her of a regiments approach from a new world lived in deep and odd expression in a full night they were to go and once found she felt that could be nothing more to take her on his death she had not been many hours at home before she found that the bright and skiing a witch lydia had given them a hint at the end was under frequent discussion between her parents the lizard had solved her activity that her father had not smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equally good the thermometer will often disheartened and never yet despair of succeeding at the last night end of chapter 3ides space x but you really need to tell you what happened very next day she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wikker this drunkness was for a project who would willingly have gone through the war without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole recent mankind and i was not saying i was not going to go to the war i was not saying i was going to go to the war with you i was just not making one good sort of man that made it has been shifting about pretty much from my part i am not going to believe it all darks i was just saying it was sometimes i thought i was going to get some of you okay i do not know when i have been more sharp as a chief so very bad its almost past belief and poor on this drc dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too and to a hatred of the sister it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel it so oh no my regrettable pressure all done away my singing i know you will do him such ample justice and i am going every moment war unconcert and indifference your profusion makes me saving and if you lament all very much longer my heart will be as light as a feather poor wickham there is such an expression such an emptiness and gentleness and anger there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever and taking so decided to dislike to him no no reason it is such a spurred ones genius such an opening for wit have a dislike of that kind one may be continually abusive without saying anything just but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something withy easy and you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i may say unhappy there was no one to speak to about what i felt no change completely they did not be in severe defeat fain nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you no how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickum to mr darcy poor now they do appear wholly undeserved certainly but the misfortune that speaking with bitterness is the most never consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i ought or not to make our creases in general understand wickums character this meant the positive but not sure if it could be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully what is your opinion that it not not to be attempted mr darcy is not authorized me to make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavor to undecene people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent it would be the death of half the good people in the parent too attempt to place him in an angry little fight i am not equal to it wickum will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is sometimes hands it will be all found out then we may be laughed at their stupidity and not knowing it before that present i was saying nothing about it but i am not a lie i am not a lie i am not a lie i am not a lie i am not a lie i am not a lie i am not a lie i am not a lie i am not a lie i am not a lie i am not a lie i am not a lie i am not a lie i am not a lie whenever she might wish to talk again either and there was still something working behind of which prudence forbade the disclosure she dared not relate the other half of mr darcys letter or explained to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend here was an allege in which no one could take and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understand when you are on strike funny why he is干 unboxing and yes protested that anann said she… if that variable advantage ever taking place it tasked to deal with a lot more incredible matters the liberty of communicationconopiemai strange character told him that at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters spirits james not happy she still cherished a very tender affection for binhui having never even fancy herself in love with sure her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition raider steadiness then most cherished attachments off to her host and so were evently de chievalu is remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends and her requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been in the jurys to her own hell and their tranquility well busy zemiz has been in one day what is your opinion now this sad business of james before my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody i told my sister philip so the other day but i cannot find out that james or anything of him in london he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose theres the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk of his coming to another field again at the summer and i have inquired for everybody too who is likely to know and i do not believe he will ever live at another field anymore oh well it is just as he chooses nobody wants him to come the wise shall always say he used my daughter to extremely ill and if he has her i will not have to help him if it is i am sure james will die of broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer well lizzy continue to her mother soon afterwards and so that the colonns is very comfortable to be doing well i only hope that we will last and what sort of team will thank you charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say if she is not i sure if his mother she is saving enough theres nothing extravagant in their house i dare say no nothing at all a great deal of good management dependable in it yes yes they will take care not to outrun their income they will never be distressed for money but what is good man to tell and so as it was they who had to talk about having one who is going to raise their own daughter to stay in their house man man why is he still wearing men here same line in my familys house even as a subject which they could not mention they would be in jail no it would be strange if they had to pay for the property and they would be in jail they would be in jail they would be in jail they would be in jail they would be in jail they would be in jail they would be in jail they would be in jail they would be in jail they would be in jail they would be in jail man man man man it was the last of the regiments day in maryland and all the young ladies in the neighborhood were drooling in the face the objection was close to the person the elder mismanence of the woman who was still able to bring the drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their appointments and when they were free the day when they approached the disowning sense of the white kid and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such a part of the heart of this in any of the family good heaven what has to become of us what do we do would they often exclaim in the bitterness of the world how can you be smiling so busy their affection and mother share for their peace she remembered that she and her son the leader of the civil society okay ah thats good and the eye and the eye so she might cry for two days together when colonel millers regiment went away i thought i should have broken my heart why am sure i shall break mine sit lydia if one could but go to brighten observe since then he is the one who never knew the whole world is so disobeyed the least he gave it his way of remembering and my efforts to show him to me and the great deal of good and in kidding such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longborn house elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame she felt the new that justice of mr darcys objections and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend but the blue of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighten this invalue of the friend was a very young woman and very lately married others and lives in good human and good spirits id recommend it her and lydia to each other and out of there three months of waitings they had been intimate the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs forster the delight of mrs bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely described holy inattentive to her sisters feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy calling for everyones congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlor repigned at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was pivish i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia such she though i am not her particular friend i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more to for i am two years older in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered as lieutenant war in all possible and said to the actor and detestable as such a step must make her or no she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behavior the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster and the probability of her being yet more improved with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home he hurt her attentively and then said did i ever be easy until she has exposed herself to some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances if you were aware sidilusman the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and imprudent manner which is already a reason for it im sure you would judge it too all ready ovis ill be dismissed but as she finds the way some of your lovers who are that busy would do not be cast down such squeamish youths is cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity or not worth a regret come let me see the list pitiful fellows who have been kept a new flight lydias folly indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not a particular but of general evils which i am now complaining our importance are this possibility in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydias character excuse me but i must speak plainly if you might hear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits end up teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment her character will be fixed and she will at 16 be the most determined flurb that ever made herself more repented of her assert too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth an atollerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal content which her rage for admiration will excite in this danger kitty also is comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vane ignorant idol and absolutely uncontrolled her heart cant suppose if possible that they will mark the censored and despise wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace mr bennett saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said and reply do not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jr known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters we shall have no peace at longborn as lydia does not go to brighton let her go then perth of forster is a sense for man and books you are at any real mischief and she is motherly too for to be an object of prey to anybody at brighton she will be a less important even as a common servant that she has been here the officers will find women better worth it let us hope therefore that her being their mayteacher her whole insignificant at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and soaring it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their unitedfoliability if lydias imagination of visit to brighton comprised every possibility of birthly having this she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gaybaving place covered with officers she saw herself the object of attention two tens and two scores of them at present unknown she saw all the glories of the camel its tense stretched forth in beauties uniformity of lines crowded with the young eyegay and dazzling with scarmine and to complete the view of how she saw herself seated beneath the tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once had she known her sister sought to tear her from such a prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for her noonecalleating vision of her husbands never intended to go there himself but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their rapture continued with little information to the very day of lydias leaving home elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of formal partiality entirely so she had even learned to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to discuss in his presence he gave her to herself she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of for newing those intentions which had marked in the early part of their acquaintance could have only served him after what had since passed and to reveal her she lost all concern for him infronting herself thus as selecting this object as such i dont have the full of scallotry while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing then however long and whenever cause his intentions have been ignored her vanity would be gratifying and her presence in this issue and in her turn and id be glad to have met her id be glad to have met her id be glad to have met her he died with other of the officers at longmore and so little was a elizabeth disposed to depart from him in good humor but on his making some inquiry as to the matter in which her time had passed a tons份 she mentioned her and her lawyers and mr darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he was acquainted with the former he looked to surprise displeased alarm with the most recollection in a returning soil replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very charming like man after how she liked him our hands were in his favor we had an air of indifference and so enough to whats added how long did you say he was up to rosings nearly three weeks and you saw him frequently yes almost every day his manners are very different from his cousins yes very different but i think mr darcy improves upon a quince indeed hes a little bit more mature but hes not a scaper and i ask him but checking himself he added in the care to him is it in address the as he had done and told him to have a little bit of a deal in his poor very style or i dare not he continued an lower more serious tone that he has improved in essentials oh no settle this with in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was while she spoke we come looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust in their meaning there was something in her account which made me listen to that for him and he has attention i have a lot of money and i said i dont know what hes doing i didnt know he was blind to his parents i was wearing a statement for movement with it i know we had a girl his disposition is better but youre stupid what hes alarm now what youre in you know hes a bunch of people and im not even a single person im not even a single person im not even a single person im not even a single person im not even a single person hes a person hes a person hes a person hes a person you who is so wellknown i feel it to work mr doris who barely comprehend how hes here i must be a choice that he is why is enough to assume even the appearance of what is right he is pride in that direction maybe of the surprise of himself to many others ive only deter him for such a foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that this sort of cautionness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visit to his heart as which good opinion and judgment he stands for in all his fear of her as always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forewitting the match with mr berg which my or certainly is very much an art well elizabeth could not repress this smile with this but she answered only by a slight inclination of that she saw people into a major on people so checked up his grievances and no ones from her no ones from her rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of the useful cheerfulness but with no further attempt to distinguish his eye and they parted in last and he was in a a a a a a a when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to maryton from wednesday were to set out early the next morning the separation between her and her family was rather noisy and pathetic kitty was the only one who shendiers muching for his belief in the wrong way and in his men and womens views muching for the city of the world and in the rest of the dinner in junctions that future of no place you dont have to do i dont even know where he was i dont even know whats going on ive had advice which there was every reason to be able to be wellrended to you didnt remember us having this whole idea of herself and it didnt grow well the more gentle it used for her sisters and her husband without her husband and ill check her for anyone this is a liberal box with party a liberal box for parties a liberal box a liberal box this reading by kara shallonberg wwwkrayorg pride and prejudice by jane austen chapter 42 and 43 chapter 42 had elizabeths second without her husband without her husband i dont remember more than being a peep ive gone to go to the local party or to domestic comfort her father had to be beside you and that appearance was more than excuse and use general and guilt at very little moment he was weak and understanding the liberal mind had very early in the marriage put an end to all real affection for her respect esteem and confidence had vanished forever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown but miscarbentants was not ever this position to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often control the unfortunate for their fathers or the kind you respond of the country and the books and from these tastes that are really important to all in your life to his wife he was very little otherwise together then asked for ignorance and thought that he could be this too this is not the sort of happiness which man would in general wish to owe to his wife but for other powers of any of his fathers own the truth was that elizabeth comes such as our given elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behavior as a husband she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for her affection that treatment of herself she endeavored to forget what she could not overlook and to vanish from her thoughts that continual beats to congregal obligation and decorum which and exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible but she would never felt so strongly as now that this advantage is which must attend the children of so unsuitable marriage or ever but so familiar with either arising from so illguid in the power silence which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a motherandsister whos constant reprimations at the belvers of everything around them through a real blue over there the messick circle and though it might encounter again her natural degree of sense since the horrors of her brain will remove her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assured by a situation thats a double danger as a watering place and a count upon the whole therefore she found her sometimes been found before that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not in taking place wring all the satisfaction she had promised herself it would consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual publicity there was some other point on which prohibitions and hopes might be fixed and by a dad enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console her head for the present and prepare for a moment to point me her tour to the lake was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours for this contingent of her mother and kittenmade inevitable and could she have included jane and the scheme every part of it would have been perfect but it is fortunate that she that i have something to wish for for the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized a scheme of which every part promised is delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only awarded off by the defensive some little peculiar vexation when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely do her mother and kitten but her letters were always longexpected and always very short those to her mother contained with her else then that they were just returning from the library for such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully a little bit of light to leave off in the library as this is for her and they were going off to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learned for her letters to kitty no rather longer for much too full of lines under the words to be made public after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humor and cheerfulness began to reappear at longborn everything wore a happier aspect the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagement arose mrs bennett was restored to her usual far less serenity and by the middle of june if he was so much recovered as to be able to enter maritime without tears and events of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be courted in maritime the time fixed for the beginning of their norther and tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs gardner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent mr gardner would be prevented by business from setting out to a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short of period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the linear and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contrasted tour and according to the private land or to go no farther north north than darbyshire in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their few weeks and to mrs gardner it had a peculiarly strong attack the power was she had formerly passed some years of her life and for they were now in the end a few days was probably as great as the opportunity as all the celebrated beauties of matlach chatsworth don dale or the peak he was a bath that was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been to the top but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again with the mention of darbyshire there were many ideas connected it was impossible for her to see the work without any numbering and its owner but surely that she our main enter his county without impunity and robert of a few petrified spars without his preceding the period of expectation was now doubled four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt arrived but they did pass away and mr and mrs gardner with their four children did at length appear at longborn the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys or to be left under the particular chair of their cousin jane who was the general favorite and whos steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them playing with them and loving them the gardeners stayed only one night at longborn and set off and externing matheelas bath in pursuit of novelty and amusement one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness of companions a suitableness which comprehended health and tempered to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if they were disappointment to thrive it is not the object of this work to give a description of garbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places that theyre about to learn and um warwick camelwrest birmingham etc are sufficiently known a small part of garbyshire is all the present concern to the little town of lampton the scene of mrs gardners former residents and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lampton luzubeth found from her aunt that can barely was situated it was not an indirect road nor more than a mile or two out of it in talking over there route the evening before this is gardner expressed an inclination to see the place again mr gardner declared his willingness and ela zabeth was applied to for her activation my love should you not like to see a place of which you have heard so much separate a place too with which so many of you are acquaintances are connected with them passed all his youth there you know luzubeth was distressed she felt that she had no business at hermerely and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it she must own that she was tired of seeing great houses after going over so many she really had no plegering fine carpets or satin curtains mrs gardner abused her stupidity i said were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful they have some of the finest ones in the country he must have said no more but her mind could not act reass the possibility of meeting mr darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred she blushed at the very idea and thought all she better to speak openly to her aunt than to run into her risk but again this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfaithably answered accordingly when she retired at night she asked for the chamber maid whether her family were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the sun a most welcome negative followed the last question after a long now being removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme to pamperly therefore they were to go and after 42 she was at the 40th he was the best as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when it leg they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter the park was very large and contained great variety of ground they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot at point of view they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of the tree quite a wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by a bemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance of a solid wooded greater but we know how this will appear its thanks for neither formal nor falsely adorned elizabeth was delighted she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or her natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the mirror aspect of the house all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned she dreaded less the chamber name had been discovered on a fine to see the place they were admitted into the hall and he lived at as they waited for the house he was i believe if he wondered how could he be in the house who was the housekeeper came they were expectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had in the house followed her into the dining pile it was a large wellproportioned room and some we fitted it up in elizabeth after a slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect the hill found with wood they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the line of the valley as far as we could trace it with delight as they passed into other rooms these objects were taken different positions but from everyone knows they were viewed to be seen the rooms were lofty and handsome and theyre furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his piece that was neither gruddy nor uselessly fine with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings and of this place thought she i might have been mistress with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but no recollecting herself that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something very life regret she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent but had not the courage for it id like however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm mrs reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him to borrow with a large party of friends how rejoiced was he elizabeth that their own journey had not found any circumstance theyd delay today her aunt now called her to look at a picture she approached and saw the lightness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures of the demands of these her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it the housekeeper came forward and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman the son of her late master stewart who had been brought up by him at his own expense he is now gone into the army and she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild mrs gardner looked at her niece with a smile but he was about to not return it and that the little friend pointing to another of the miniatures is my master and very light him it was gone at the same time as the other about eight years ago i have heard much of your masters buying person that mrs gardner looked at the picture it is a handsome face but mrs gardner you can tell us whether it is like or not mrs gardners respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this information of her knowing her master this is that young lady no mr darsen you are the best color and said a little and do you not think him a very handsome gentleman now yes very handsome i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer larger picture of him that looks this room was my late masters favorite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then he was very fond of them this accounted to elizabeth when he was twofooted in the month mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of mr darsen drawn when she was only eight years old and is mr darsen as handsome as her brother said mrs gardner oh yes the handsomeest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished she plays and sings all day long and the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master she comes here tomorrow with him mr gardner whose manners were very easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs reynolds either by pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking up her master and his sister is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and mr darsen is always down for the summer months except thought he was about when she goes to ramsgate if your master would marry you might see more of him yes sir but i do not know when that would be if you do not know who is good enough for him mr and mrs gardner smile you little about could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so i say no more than the truth and everybody will say that no of him replied the other he was a best thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never known a crossword from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas that he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying there are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky in having such a master yes sir i know i am if i were to go through the world i could not meet with the better but i have always observed that they who are giving me true attention a good nature when they grow up and who was always the sweetest tempered most generous heart had boy in the world he looked at the almost stared at her can this be mr darcy thought she his father was an excellent man mrs gargoye yes maam that he wasnt meath and his son will be just like him just as applicable to the poor he looked at that listen one nerd youted and was impatient for more mrs ranult could interest her on no other point she related the subjects for the characters the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain mr gardner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together of the great staircase he is the best landlord and the best master such he that ever lived not like the wild young men nowadays who think of nothing but themselves there is not one of his tenants or servants that will give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw anything of it to my sense it is only because he does not travel away like other young men in what an annual delight does this place him thought he lives about this fine account of him this great her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behavior to our poor friend perhaps we might be deceived that is not very likely our authority was too good on reaching the spacious lobby about they were shown into a very pretty sitting room lately fitted up with great her elegance and lightness than the apartments we love and the worrying formed that it was but just done to give pleasure to mr darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley he is certainly a good brother said he lives about as she walked towards one of the windows mrs reynolds anticipated mr darcys delight when she should enter the room and this is always the way with him she added whatever can give his sister any pleasure in short to be done in a moment there is nothing he would not do for her the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms were all that remained to be shown in the former or many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of mr darcys in crayons who was subject to a little more interesting and also more intelligible in the gallery there were many family portraits and they would have little to fix the attention of a stranger in the left he left in the quest of the only face whose features would be known to them at last in a rest of her and she would be held a strike in resemblance to mr darcys in the face as she would remember to have some time to see her she stood several minutes before the picture in our next presentation and returned to the gallery where they took the gallery this is reynolds in huangs room that it had been taken in his fathers lifetime there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their craft the commendation be stood on him by mrs reynolds was of no crackling nature what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship how much of pleasure and pain was it in his power to be still how much of good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favorable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its love and selfadmitted to the pride he had been structured when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned downstairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door as they walked across the hall towards the river he lived the best turned back to look again for uncle and aunt stop also and while the former was the nectar and asked the day to the village the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables they were within twenty yards of each other and so a brush was in the parent that it was impossible to avoid his face their eyes instantly met and the cheek still stood when overspread with the deepest flesh he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise but shortly recovered himself advanced for the harder and so familiar that its not in terms of perfect composure and need the perfect fidelity she had instinctive return to land but stopping on his approach received this compliment with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome had his first appearance our hand resembled to the picture they had just been examined and insufficient to assure the other two of that they now saw mr darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes his face and knew not what answers she returned to his civil inquiry after her family a maze that the alteration of his manners since they last part had every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the emperor prior to her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left longborn and of her having stayed in darbys room so often and in so hurryed away as plainly spoke to the destruction of his thoughts edlin every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave the others then joined her and expressed admiration of his figure but he was about her not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence she was overpowered by shame and of exacetion for coming there was the most unfortunate the most illjudged thing in the world how strange it must appear to him and what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem that if she had purposely wronging herself in his way again oh why did she come or why did he thus come a day before he was expected edlin only came in it sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment a lighted from his horse or his carriage she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting and his behavior so strikingly altered what could it mean that he should even speak to her was amazing but to speak with such civility to inquire after her family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had you spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think or how to account for it they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a noblur fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was sometimes before he knew about what sensible and any of it and so she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects that they pointed out she distinguished no art of the scene but thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy then was she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everything she would still be able to perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her it could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mine the rouse chair and she felt necessity of appearing more like herself they entered the woods and bidding a view to the river for a while ascended some of the higher ground when in the spot where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander for many charming views of the valley the opposite pose with the long range of woods spreading in and occasionally part of the tree mr gardner expressed the wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond the walk with a triumph of smile they were told that it was ten miles round it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts they crossed it by a single bridge in the car and the river there was a spot less adorn than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed him only for the streets and the narrow one by the rough copper squid which ordered it he was about long to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house this is gardner the water was not a great water but so no farther and thought only a returning to the car is just like the impossible the moon was there for a blind and they took me out and it was a fire in the nearer direction but their progress was low from mr gardner they saw the table from those to the very farther fishers it was so much engaged to watch the amazing appearance and the sound of the water and talking to the man about them and he had found the water whilst wandering on in this low manner they were again surprised and the elizabeth astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr gardners approaching them and at no great distance the walk here being less mature than on the other side allowed them to see them before they met elizabeth however astonished was that least more prepared for an interview than the four of them and resolved to appear and speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them for a few moments in each you tell that you would come to be strife and do some other paths the idea lasted while attorney you walked concealed him from that view the turning pass he was immediately before them with a glance she saw that he had lost none of her reach to the village and to imitate his flight and she began to send that to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words they liked her and her husband was trying some unlawful recollections that proved it and she fancied that praise of her ability to assert my deepest image to this place of truth her color changed and she said no more mrs gardner was standing on the little behind and on her closing he asked her if she would do him the honor of this place she was so proud to be able to prove that she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself what would be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are he gets them now from the full affection the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a slide and look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions that he was surprised by the connection was evident and he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr gardner he was about not by the police could not but triumph it was consoling that you should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush she listened most attentively to all that passed between him and glory in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy invite him with a greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighborhood offering him the same time to fly in with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport this is gardner who is looking arming in arm with he was in that narrow for a look expressive of a wonder he was about to send up and get it right inside her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself or astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so cultured from what she had perceived it cannot be for me it cannot be for my state that was mannered or thus thought of but my reproved that hunts were it could not work such a change as this it isnt possible that this should still have me after walking in some time it has to be a due lady that hunts between gentleman and her eyes im revealing their places after descending to the break of the river for the better inspection and serious water plant theres chance to be a little alteration it originated in mrs gardner who was the key for the exercise of the morning found the elizabeth arm in adequate for her support and consequently referred to the list of mr gardner who came from her place by her knees and then walked on again after a short silence the lady first saw she wished to know which she had been extraordinarily absentee before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be her child tomorrow and indeed before we left fake well we understood that you were not in any of this evidence she acknowledged the truth of it and said that business with her steward had occasioned this coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with me had been traveled they were going the early tomorrow if its a good and a moment of our summer well come out in the next week mr bingman and his sister and this is an end for the elizabeth arm but her thoughts were instantly driven back to the five things to think he had been the last mention between them and if she might judge by his collection this body was not very different than he did there was also one other person in the party he continued after her thoughts who were particularly wishes to be known to you who will allow me or to ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your standup but surprise of such an application of the great indeed it was too great for her to know and put matters yet and immediately felt that whatever desire would start to have a key point in the left or a perfect brother and without looking far there the status of her train it was great to know that this resentment and not make this a real deal they now walk five in silence each of them deep in thought elizabeth was not comfortable that doesnt possible but she was smarter than her she was wishful to be a sister to her acquaintance to find her and soon outstrip to the others and come and have reached her and she started to learn how to control her but not in the end she then asked her to walk into her but she declared her son not tired and shes been together and shes been together and at which of her time to much like her been said and silence was really awkward she wanted to talk but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject at last she recollected that she was in trouble and they talked with metlocke and does their own great perseverance that crying meant her and including slowly and her patience and her ideas were only worn out before they had a tent for over on this journey this is darkening they were all fresh to link the puzzle to fix the question and theyve argued on each side of the unknown to the life mr darcy handed the ladies into marriage and from her law to the left side and from her who are not allowed to the observations of her uncle and aunt and each of them pronounced him to be infinite and superior to anything they had expected he is perfectly well behaved polite and im assuming that her uncle there is something a little state in him to be sure youre blivering but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can now say with the housekeeper that those some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it he was never more surprised than violence behavior to us it was more than simple it was really a team too and there was no necessity for such attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling to be sure lizzie said her hand he is not so mens and as a victim or rather he must not be the victims criminal or his features are perfectly well but how can you tell me that he was so disobeyable elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they had met in kent then before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities or plied around you are a great man off an hour and therefore i shall not take him at his work as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character but said nothing from what we have seen of him continued his lives now i really should not have thought that he could not be paid and so brutal away by anybody as he has done by four victims he has not been able to make a joke on a contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks and there is something on dignity in his countings that would not give one an unfavorable idea of his heart but to be sure the good lady who showed us his house did give him the most flaming character i could hardly help laughing around sometimes but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of the servant he had to get a remerchant elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something and vindication has behaved to wicke and therefore gave them to understand in his guarded manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different approach and had heard that by no means of problems there were weapons to serve you to be built and they had been defeated in hardship in confirmation of this she related the particular of all the peculiarity transactions in which they had been connected without actual naming her authority but stating it to be such a mighty delight this is our year as surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former focus every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much on a day to take the opportunity and she had all the regrets and the desire to take that opportunity out but he knew that she had been by the nine months they had no sooner dying than she said often getting a lot of different worldnotchened opinions and the evening was thanks to the satisfaction that her nature first knew that the many were just to be us the adventures of the day were too full of interest to leave it live without much attention for anything all the revocations are in the public domain for more information or development here these visit live revocs stuff this reading and my gratitude pride and kindness by jane austen kevin elizabeth had settled in this red arse and brings his visit the very day after her new chambering and she was constantly dissolved not to be out of sight of the end of the whole of that morning but her conclusion was false for a very morning after her arrival at lantern hes visitors came theyve been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returning to the end of the dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of the carriage you go to the window and they saw a gentleman on the lead in a peripheral driving up the street elizabeth immediately erected the cemetery against what had been it and departed no small degree of her surprise to her relations by equating them with the honor of which she expected her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined just the circumstances itself and many of the circumstances at the preceding day opened to them and you idea onto business nothing had ever suggested it before but they felt that there was no other way but only the such attention its considered for her that by proposing her marriage challenge well these newly born notions were passing their heads the perturbation of elizabeths feelings was evident in her relationship she was quite amazed at her own disclosure but amongst other causes and disquiet she read it as the partiality of her version of st georges favorite and more than commonly anxious to be able to understand the natural aspects that every power of pleasing the male male male male she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room and devouring to the poiser itself saw such looks that inquirings her prize in her uncle and aunt has made everything worse mr carson had her brother up here and this formidable introduction to the place with astonishment little as the sea that her new witness was at least as much embarrassed as herself since her being at lampton she had heard that mr c was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy she found it difficult to obtain you know where the heart is mr c was taught that she was not a longawaited man and the little boy was sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance woman was just handsome and her brother and her husband and her husband and her husband and her husband and her husband and her husband and her husband and her husband they had not long been together before mr darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visit her when bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs in an moment and her room all elizabeths anger against him had been long and unaway but had she still felt any could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected corgiality with which she expressed himself on seeing her again he inquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good mover he used that he had ever felt mr and mrs gardner he was scarcely less interesting personage that to herself they had long wished to see him the whole party before that indeed excited a lively attention the suspicion which had just arisen is the darcy and her niece directed their observation towards each other and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love of the ladies sensations they remained a little endowed but that the gentleman was overflowing with that her racial and severed him out elizabeth on her side was to do she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each others the situation she wanted to be a loser and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to be never to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favor bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a light manner sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once her twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behavior to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival to jane no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred air they parted which in her anxious interpretation do you know to direct a recollection of jane not untingured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared he observed her at a moment when the others were talking to you and didnt tell her which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he had it it was above eight months we have not met in the 26th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest but theyre all her sisters were a long way there was not much in the question or in the preceding remark but there was a look at a matter which gave them to me it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself but whenever she did catch it glimpse she saw an expression of general complacence and in all that he said she heard an accident sort of moved from water or to stain of his companions as convinced her with the improvement of matters which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence may prove at at least outlive one day when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance according to the opinion any intercourse of him unsuitable within his grace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relation as he had opened in his name and recollect him in the last light we see in his first speech the difference the change so great it struck so possibly unremind that you could hardly restrain her astonishment in the name of his own never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield were as dignified relations at bruising as she seen him so disastrous to pleans to free from selfconservance or unbending desire as now in no importance for result in success of his endeavors and when even the acquaintance of those didnt visit tensions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies with a netherfield and bruisingness their visitor stayed with them above half an hour and when they arose to the part mr garcin palman this is where you join and expressing their wishes to see mr garcin and respect to dinner at temporarily before the bell rang mr garcin the winner in the next part will look for a happy new year patience italy obeyed mrs garcin or look at her niece his iris and her teeth and the engagement of the sir help to speak in sentence and acceptance but elizabeth is her presuming however that this study of witness is worth rather a number to embarrass her and dislike and see if it was her husband who is part of society a perfect willingness to accept it to menor and gain her parents and see if it may happen in the next weeks bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again and being still at great deal to save to her and many inquiries to make after all her picture of friends elizabeth who is all this information that the mirspcc is pleased and of this account as well as others found herself with her visitors that people of considering will last half hour some satisfaction the while it has been joined as evidently literature eager to be alone and fearful of the infreaserance of a woman who stayed with her for a long time to hear her people will appear in a bingley then her eager way to rest which had no reason to fear as to her in this regard her is very else it was not their wish to force her in the occasion it was evident that she was much better acquainted with this regard she even made before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her and saw much to interest but nothing to justify of mr darcy who is called after a names height and as far as there is witness reach there is no fault to find they could not be untouched by his playlists and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference to any other account the circle in her picture to which he was known would not have recognized it for mr darcy there was now an interest however in believing nows keeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own matters indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected either had anything occurred in the intelligence of their laptop friends that could materially less of its weight they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be a huge burden by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family could not visit who is acknowledged for the land he was given with respect to wickham the traveler soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a wellknown fact that on his quitting derby shirt he had left many debts behind him which mr darcy afterwards discharged as for elizabeth her thoughts were peppermint the same thing more than the last the evening though as it passed seem long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one dimension and she lay away two whole hours endeavoring to make them out she certainly did not even no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling i dislike against her the respect for the fact that the fiction of his valuable qualities though it first unwillingly admitted and for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friend who year nature by the testimony so highly in his favor and bringing forward his disposition and so amiable light which yesterday produced but above all above respected esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overmoked it was gratitude gratitude not merely for having more love turn but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulants and acrobatic of her manner in rejecting her and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection he who shaked their sleep for a boy who was supposed to stand seemed on this accidental meeting and most eager to preserve the equities and without any indelic display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only for concern was eliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her know it in his sister such a change in a man of so much pride exciting thought for astonished gratitude for to love art and love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means of pleasing though it could not be exacting defined she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt her real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that will have to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her shes supposed to ask of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece that such a striking civility as mr sees can come to see them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to elect breakfast ought to be imitated though they got to be full by some exorcism of that son there side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning and were therefore to go elizabeth was phoenix though she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in the plot mr gardner left them soon after breakfast the fishing scheme had the burden the day before and a positive engagement made up his beatings from the gentleman at pemberley before name chapter 45 convinced as elizabeth now was that ms bingleys dislike of her and originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how unwellcomfortable appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed on reaching the house they were shown through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer its windows opening to the ground and mitted a most refreshing view of the hide woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oats and spanish chestnuts which have a good view in this house they were seen by ms darcy who was sitting there with mrs hurst and ms bingley and the lady who she lived in london george annas reception of the most very civil but attended with all the embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and appear doing calm but easily get to those and felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and deserved mrs gardner and her niece will be in her justice and fitting her by mrs hurst and ms bingley who were noticed only by a prison and on their being seated a pause offered as such pauses and always be seen in her hand it was first heard by mrs annsey who had taken to the real woman whos never introduced in the kind of discourse who could be more clearly wellbred than either of the others and between her and mrs gardner who had taken her to the key for help and was a better husband and wife and she was a real man mrs darcy who was introduced in the first 20 minutes and sometimes did ventral short sentence and the whole thing is to be more a lizard bit but some saw that she was himself was the watchman speaking and that she could not speak for her especially since i was in the south of holland for attention this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter and they not been seated at any of the media assistants but she was not sorry to be spared than this assistant she expected a moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scare someone after sitting in this matter a quarter of an hour without hearing the screen reads voice elizabeth was roused by her sitting from her the cold and prey after the health of her family she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the others said no more the next variation which benefited a fourday different spreaders by the entrance of service with cold meat cake and variety of all the finest fruits and season the this topic plays till after the music didnt have to be lost or out of the sense that she does first and will give it another her final round of post there is now employment for the whole party for the lake could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes snitching and some creatures soon collected to the crowd with you well less engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity to decide if the weather she holds fear or wish her parents and his daughters by the few days of prevailed on the second and then the minimum of the war she would wish her to be gone she began to regret the key he had been some time with mr gardner who was to work for the other gentleman from the house was engaged by the river and it left him only on learning the ladies of the family intended to visit to georgia at that morning the sooner did he appear that elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy the resolution for the rest of the day the rest of the day was not the most easy account because she saw that they suspected that the whole party were awake at the beginning and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behavior in the first few days the no countenance was a tentative curiosity so strongly marked as in this big news in spite of the smiles which over spread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects and her jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attention to mr gardners legacy were by no means over this darcy on her brothers entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side this big way saw all this likewise and the impudence of anger to the first opportunity of saying this hearing disability pray this elijah are not the blank sure militia removed from maryton they must be a great gloss to your family in darcys presence she dared not mention who comes in but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was up for most of her thoughts and the maryens recollections connected with him and he heard the distress but he was already here so many years later and he felt hed be able to take your attack and he visited answered the question that horrible detached her tone while she spoke and in voluntary glance she heard darcy with a heightened impression furnace we looking at and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to look up her eyes had misfiguredly no but means she was then giving her beloved threat she undoubtedly would have restrained her pain but she had nearly intended to disclose elizabeth by bringing her the idea of a hand which will lead her to her home to make her betray as a civilian which might injure her in darcys opinion and perhaps remind the latter of all the fallies and absurdities that would some partner for family were connected with that force not a syllable had ever reached sure of as darcys meditated a local to no creature had it been revealed where secrecy was possible except to elizabeth and from all big leaves connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from the very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him under becoming her after her whole he had certainly formed such a plan and he felt meaning that it should affect his endeavor to separate him from the standard it is probable that it might add something whose livelihood can turn for the welfare of his friend elizabeths collective behavior over seemed quite a busy lecture and as mispingly next time theres not a closure to wicked georgiana also recovered in time but not enough to be able to speak anymore her brother whose eyes she feared to meet scarcely recollect her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to to fix them on her mourn and more carefully there a visit did not continue long after the question that answered her bellpunched and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage this beingly was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person the behavior and dress the georgiana the doctor her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favor his judgment could not air and he had spoken at such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise the lovely and avial the darcy returned to the saloon as bigly could not help repeating to him some part of when she had been saying to his sister a very illnessalyze event looks this morning mr darcy she cried i never in my life saw anyone so much alter this she is since the winter she has grown so brown in course louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again however little mr darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with wholly replying that he perceived no other alteration that her bringing rather tan no miraculous consequence of traveling in the summer for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her her faces to thin her complexion has no brilliance and her features are not at all handsome her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines her teeth are tolerable when not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i could never see anything extraordinary in them they have a sharp shrewish look to do not like it all and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency without fashion which is intolerable persway to dismiss beingly was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and its seeing him at last look somewhat vevel she had all the success she expected who is reasonably silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in her culture how amazed we all were to find that shes a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at another field she abutty i should have soon called her mother a wit but afterwards she seemed to improve on you i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that was only when i first saw her for it as many months since i considered her as one of the handsomeest woman of life he then went away and this beingly was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what he even no one any pain but herself this is gardner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during that her visit as the return except when in particular it was interest of both the look and behavior of everybody they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of everything by himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what this is gardner thought of him and mrs gardner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning this subject and of chapter 45 recorded march 4th 2006 in bishop california this is elizabeth oxford all elizabeth oxford are in the public domain for more information are to volunteer please go to librevoxorg recorded by efaccurrit pride and prejudice by jane austen chapter 46 in 47 chapter 46 elizabeth had been a good deal to support it in that point in a letter for jane on their first arrived at blomdor and this to support meant had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repigning was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been misced elsewhere elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them quiet set off by themselves the one misced must first be attended to it had been written five days ago the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written an evident agitation gave more important in intelligence it was to this effect since writing the above during this busy something has occurred of the most unexpected and serious nature but im afraid of alarming you heres short that we are over what i have to say relates to all you do an expressed criminal trial last night just as we were all gone to bed from colour four star to inform us that she was going to be with one of his uncles to own the truth with wicked imagine our supplies to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected im very very sorry so improved into match on both sides but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood forklift and industry i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice marks nothing but a target his choice is this interested at least for him must know my father can give her nothing or poor mother or sadly my father bears her better and half thankful i am that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves they were off saturday night at about 12 as his injection which we noticed at two guests a day morning at eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us colonel forstrum gives us reason to expect him here soon little elected few lines for his wife informing him of the way of tension i must be tuned for i cant be long for my poor mother im afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written without allowing herself time for consideration im sparsely knowing what she felt elizabeth unthinishing this little girl unthinishing this letter instantly sees the other and opening it with the utmost impatience greta spombs it happened and david became a crucial first by this time my dear sister you have received my herid letter i wish this making more intelligent but dont worry about my heart my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent dear lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cant be done if we lose a marriage between mr wippin and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be ashamed to just take it first for those who are torturing me and not torturing me colonel forstrum came yesterday having left bright in the day before not many hours after the express though lydias short letter to mrs f gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w never intended to go there artumary lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off from being intending to trace their root he did trace them easily to clap but no further for on entering that place they removed into a happily coach and dismissed the shades that brought them from epsom all that is known after this that they were seen to contain all london road i know not what to think after making every postwinning query on that side london colonel f came on into hufffordshire i actually see renewing them at all the turnpipes and at the ends of barnerton hufffield but with her dennystit says no such people have been seen to pass through with the pines to kiss her and he came up to london a broke us up with the bitches and a violent gross regretting on his heart i have seen two people who are in the house of the london people and blame i distress my dear lizzy this very great my father i am still trying to stop so ill many circumstances might make a more emotional to go to marry five of the entire that you pursue the first one and even if you could walk such a dissonance against the young woman of lydias connections which is not likely how i suppose her so lost to the woman that you can possibly find however but colonel f is not disposed to depend upon the marriage he should kiss headlikes for her who is not said he threw the double ear was not allowed to be trusted my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room i am just a problem i never have my life so busy poor pity has anger for having continued to touch it but the assist was a matter of confidence but cannot wonder i am truly glad to be a lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over i shall own that i long for you return i am so selfish i am so selfish if inconvenient i take up my panic and do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible i know my dear uncle not all so well that i am not afraid of the question but i have still something more to ask with the fool my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her what he means to do i am sure i am not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best to complete the brain but colonel forster is obliged to be a bright and again tomorrow evening in such an exigence my uncles advice and assistance will be everything in the world he will immediately comprehend the bibles view and i will rely upon his goodness oh well why are you so happy why are you so happy i am not a good person i am not a good person even if you follow me without using a moment of the time of the session if i should look to the girl if you are going to find her i have failed to face in a country with my remaining fault and before you could recover himself to speak she was a part of the idea of superstudent or media situation based in the extent i have left you pardon for my misleading i must find you to guard the other moment or the other moment oh this is the moment and good god what is the matter right he with more feeling than brightness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after me this is bad you are not well enough to go yourself and this is a hesitated but her knees scrambled under her and she felt her little would be gained by her attempt to pursue them calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him row in so reckless and absent of made her almost an intelligence she fetched his master in this first home instantly on his quitting the room she sat down on a religious portrait and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for the darsuit to leave her art to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you presently a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill you are thank you she will find and devraint with other person there is nothing the master with me she is very ill she is very ill she is very ill she burst into tears she would and for humans could not speak another but she would not speak another but only say something indistinct to your husbands servant and observe her who can crush her his own at length she spoke again i have just heard her work it is a straightforward news it cannot be concealed from anyone my youngest sister is left with all her friends so we are good her servant is the power of her master they are gone off together from writer you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no can of she is very ill she is the worst forever thank you darsuit is fixed in a staunch route but i consider she added in the yet more agitated voice but i might have prevented it i what he was how did i explain some part of it some part of what i learned my own family how does current you have been known this could have not happened but it is all all too late now i am reaved indeed quite dark see reaved shot after a few certain yes they left writing together on sunday and what was almost but not beyond they are certainly not going to spread and what has been done what has been attempted to recover my father was gone to london and jane is written to beg my uncles immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done how is such a man and what dog i think we can be discovered but i have lost so many hours to go it is every very horrible darsuit should be spread in silent at the essence when my eyes were open to this real character oh how do i know what i want but i dare to i just need oh shes mistaken darsuit made no answer he seems scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room the earliest meditation his brow contract his air being and his lips seem absurd and it seems absurd her power is sinking everything will sink on such a secret family such a shunny she could be the wonder not you dare but the belief of his selfconfidence of nothing can solve it to the person there are four noparatation of her disperse it was our action exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honest and felt that she could have loved her as now when all love must be vain but self though its not its not a good idea that we can be rich and we can be rich its not a good idea its not a good idea and covering her face with her magic elizabeth was soon lost in the works and after a pause of several weeks it was only the first in a sense of situation by the voice of her people who were in a marital witch who was completely after a small cryo of the scant so im afraid you have been wrong and wrong in the society my heart has lost nor have i ever been to peter excuse me to stay but we will go unarraded you take her to the anywhere if you have said or done on my phone but might all her consolation to such a person but i would mention not with the very relationship which makes me purposely to ask for your words this unfortunate affair will appear to rent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing it and knowing it oh yes these are kind of the phalgias for us to pause so that all your business causes for me to be concealed unharpentry as long as it is possible i know it cannot be wrong and that relationship is again im exposed to sorrow for credit stress and you should have a couple of things when you were in prison and you live with that patient without the mon� pretty you are where you are know well i mean trying to endure what is here you are known so well im not going to say anything about that im not going to say anything about that im not going to say anything about that im not going to say anything about

that oh i wont be able to open a large one because of it it hasnt really come around so many times but now ive tons of old to mention for certain touch and delays she might accept this for huge trials 11 months after its already been completed sometimes its much more natural but ive made expect from the small things you dont have spilling but im not going to look after you though and im going to come with the incredible she had another perceived her arrangement because of her picture thats a video of any partial algebra but she was convinced that you were doing wrong sometimes another had been a thing as there are times shes raised in her room her affection took me to the middle of the portrait but never would bother object the mischievous neglecting is taking the dogs words of the girl oh how a cute little child he had she was well aware of the way to hear to see a cute mothers fault of the shadow the close and small girl in a father hes so deranged the father helps him a mother who played for the whole situation she had a father and constant intelligence after almost persuaded about helping her get down from the radio her unmasked feelings seemed of the utmost importance and she was so happy to have her child she was so happy to have her child she was so happy to have her child she was so sad to have her child but the star was found in the institute of art she eagerly committed to the cause of their summits meeting her two letters about and dwelling on the control of the vastness of the triangle and the cheek the video of a mother she was so happy to have her child she was so happy to have her child she was so happy to have her child she was so happy to have her child she was so happy to have her child she was so happy to have her child she was so happy to have her child she was so happy to have her child she was so happy to have her child she was so happy to have her child she was so happy to have her child she was so happy to have her child she was so happy to have her child but what is to be done about pembovi cried mrs gargoyle john told us this to do a serious case was it so yes and i told you we should not be able to keep our engagement that is all settled if the gift is all settled repeated the other issue ran into the world for her and are there a place which terms us for her to disclose the real truth oh that i knew how it was but wishes were vain or at least could only serve to a user in the hurry and confusion with following hour how did this be between a pleasure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment is impossible to once so you left your child yourself but she had a share of business with her as a odd and amongst the rest no one notes from the rhythm to all the friends of london which thoughts excuses for the sudden departure and hour however saw the whole being heated a mr gargoyle the meanwhile having settled for a second nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth i was always three of the one fanned herself in a shorter space of time that she could have been so forced seated in the courage and on the road too long ago end of chapter 4 to 6 recording by infecord this is a reverberate recording all reverberate recordings are in the couple to name for more information or drawn to your face visit with regards to all reading by any comment in the saviors missouri on january 9 2006 pride and prejudice by jane austen chapter 47 i have been thinking of what elizabeth said her on how as they drove from the town and the missouri i am much more inclined than i have heard to judge as well as the sister goes on the matter but appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should come such a consign a good superhero who was finally in his own perspective both friendless and who was actually staying in his personal family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best for me the strength that her friends and not said poorly could be expressed to be noticed again by the regiment at her such an affrage to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk do you really think so pride elizabeth frightening up for a moment a call in my word send mrs gardiner i begin to be of your own cause of opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honor and interest for him to be guilty of i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzie so only give him up as to believe in capable of it not perhaps in neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe in capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not focus why should they not go on this island that had been the case in the first place before i mr gardiner there is no absolute truth that they are not going to stop living all that they are removing from the shades into a hackney coat such a presumption and besides no tracing is then more to be found on the barn of the road all then suppose in them to be a mother they may be there so for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptional purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strengthen to take a more economically so lets expeditiously marry than one day than this problem but one of the stickers a lot of you fear of protection one must emerge behind it oh no no this is not likely this makes particular friends if i cant be found this persuaded of his neverending to marry her but the more never married or woman without some money cannot afford it and must play in his husbands world not attraction has sheed beyond you help and good humor that can make him for her stay for though every chance it benefits a new soulfinary love as to what restrained the apprehensions of disgrace in the poor might throw on a dishonorable and more of a curse im not able to tell you im looking at the effects that such a step can i produce but as you are the objection i am afraid it will hardwing hold to it lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine for my fathers behavior from his influence and a little attention he has ever seen to give what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father can do so to matter if you think about lydia is so wrong everything thats wrong with him has been taken with him on any terms of it in marriage it does seem and it is much shocking in the world that the new man and i are living in the middle of the city shes very important to protect her health to admit that that but really i know not what to say but helps her not being her daughter oh thats a very young man he has never been talking about serious subjects and for the last half year may 1 12 months she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner until it docked any opinions that came in her way since the blind sheer refers to order in marriage nothing but love rotation and officers have been in her head she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater more shall i call it theceptic village of her field which are naturally lively and out but you see the jane said her arm does not think so very ill of wickham as to believe in capable of you a queen is jane everything fell and who is there whatever might be their former condo that she would be capable of such an attempt to let her prove against them but jane knows as well as i do what with them really is we both know that he has been profited from every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honor that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating and do you really know all this pride mrs gardiner whose curiosity has been lowered over a hundred and six years old or lie i do indeed replied elizabeth coloring i told you the other day of his infamous behavior from mr garcia and he or herself when last at longborn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such barbarians in the morality towards and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worthwhile to relate but his lies about the whole canvily family are endless from what he said of mr garcia i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl yet he or new to the contrary himself he must know that she was as amyful and unpertending as we have found her but does lydia know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand oh yes that is the words of all till i was in pain and saw so much both of mr garcia and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the blank sheer was to leave mariton in a week or fortnight time as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i but it necessary to make our knowledge public or what use could it apparently be for anyone that the good opinion in which all the neighborhood had a fin should then be overthrown and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs gorschtert in the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that sheet could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head that such a consequence as this could ensue you may easily believe is far enough for my acts when theyre all in the corruption therefore you had no reason i suppose to leave them behind to each other not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had anything of the kind in perceptible you must be aware that hours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when he first sent to the court she was ready enough to admire her but still we all were every girl in the world knew mariton without a persons is about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy from him dayfuy and others of the regiment he treated her with more distinction again became her favorites it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey from a little bit in thoughts it was never absent fixed there by the keenest of all anguish selfreproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness they traveled as expeditiously as profitable and sleeping one night on the road reached longborn by dinner time the next day it was a comfort to live in it instead of the pain the amount of experience i lost was a bit the little hard ones attracted by the sights of a shade whose standing on the steps of the house is the enter of the cat and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of papers and prists was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them a hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down from her mothers apartment immediately met her elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes above lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives not yet for pledging but now that my dear uncle is calm i hope everything will be well is my father in town yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word and have you heard from him often we have heard only twice he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write again so he had something of importance to mention and my mother how will she how are you all my mother is tolerably well i trust but her spirits are greatly shaken she is upstairs and will have great satisfaction seeing you all she did not yet leave her dressing room mary and kooting thank heaven are quite well but you how are you pride in elizabeth you look pale how much you must have gone through her sister however assured her being perfectly well and the conversation which had been passing on this group in the morning and she said im engaged with that children she has taken into a good fortune where i had heard it bain graham to her uncle and her uncle and welcome to thank them both with alternate smiles and tears when they were all in the drawing room the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps and on their marriage mrs bennett to use a partmint they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming everybody but the person to use ill judging indulgence for errors of her daughter must principally be owing if i had been able said she to carry my point and going to brighten with all my family this would not have happened before dear lydia had nobody to take care of her why did the forces ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side but she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have the charger her but i was overruled as i always am poor dear child and now if youre a sister bennett gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the collins will turn us out before he is called in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardener after general assurances inspection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr bennett in every endeavor for recovering lydia to not give way to useless alarm editing though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton and if you days more we may gain some news of them and so we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying you not let us give it matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to grace church street and then we make him sell together as to what is to be done oh my dear brother replied mrs bennett that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them after they are married and above all keep mr bennett from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened of my whits and have such trembleings such fluttering all over me such spasm is in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart i can get no rest by night well by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any direct to me by the way she can see me but she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i know you will confide at all but mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavors in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fear and after talking with her in the can she did not understand her favor they all left her to vent all her feelings from her husband for who attended in the absence of her daughters though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no relocation for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not proven enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busy engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before one came from her books and the other from her toilet the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favorite sister who had been a member of the family had given more of trustfulness than usual to the accents of kitty as for mary she was mistracing up herself to whisper to elizabeth and the countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seen in a table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talkto of but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly conservation then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that lost a virtue in a female is irretrievable that one who falls step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behavior towards the undeserving of the other sex elizabeth lifted up her eyes into maismans but was too much oppressed to make any reply mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them in the afternoon the two elder mispennits were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all of its certain and mispen it could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard give me further particulars what do colonel forster say had they no apprehension of anything before the elotment took place they must have seen them together forever colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him this behavior was attentive and fine to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being wrong as often when that effemgency first got abroad the case in his journey and his denies convinced that with him were not married did he know that they are in a need of a law and colonel forster seemed anything to us yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing anything of their funds and when not given his real opinion about it he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am quite a hope he might have been misunderstood before until colonel forster came himself and that one of you entertained about our suppose of their being really married how is it possible that such an idea could enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sisters happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last platter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks but not before they went to brighton no i believe not and the colonel forster appeared to think well of with himself does he know his real character i must confess that he did not speak so well of with him as he formerly did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since the sad affair has taken place it is said that he left maryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false oh jane had we been less secret can we told what we knew of him this could not have happened perhaps it would have been better for puy her sister but to expose the former fault of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable we acted with the best intention could the new forster repeat the particular of lydias note of the one he brought it with him for us to see jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth he is for the contents my dear gary you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot tell flafing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning as soon as i am missed i am going to gregg and a green and i cannot guess with you i shall thank you for simple tin for there is but one man in the world i love and he is the end for that i should never have it without him so think in no harm to be off you need not send them more than longborn of my going if you do not like it for well make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wichdon what a good joke it will be i can hardly write the laughing pray make my excuses to crack for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight tell me my hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance we can at the next fall we meet with gregg clutter i shall send to my clothes when i get to longborn but i wish he would tell sally to mend a great slip and i work to most of them down before they have packed up goodbye give my love to kermit horsesaw i hope he will drink for a good journey your affection and friend lydia bennett oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had finished it what a letter is this to be written at second moment but at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of enemy my poor father how he must have felt it i never saw anyone so shocked i think it could not be for a full 10 minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house is such confusion oh jane fred elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day i do not know i hope there was lets be guarded at such a time as very difficult my mother was in hysterics and no i endeavor to give her every assistance in my powers i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the score of what might possibly happen almost took me from my faculties who attended upon her has been too much for you you do not look well oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone marion kitty has been very kind and what have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is a slight indelligant and mary studies so much that her hours of her clothes should not be broken in awe my aunt phillips came along for an untuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was a great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas had been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they should be of use to us she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of ones neighbors a system is impossible condolence and sufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to proceed while in town for the recovery of his daughter he meant i believe replied jane to go to epstein the place where they last changed horses see the postdillions and try if anything could be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clatham it had come with a fair from london and has seek off the disperpum stance of a gentleman and a lady through moving from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiry the classroom if he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fair he determined to make inquiry spare and looked at might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the thursday i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was as such a great thing to be found it was very very very so greatly discomposed but i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this and the chapter for the second chapter 48 the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennett the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him his family knew him to be on all communications a most negligent and military correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send and even a laugh they wouldnt have been glad to be served to him mr gardiner had only waited for the letters before he set up when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr bennett to return the longborn a sinister crew to the break on solution of this sister who considered it as the only security for her husband not being killed in a duel mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in heart for chair a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces she shared in their attendance a mrs bennett and was a great comfort to them in their hours of free their other arms he was always on all ways as she said with the design of cheering and partnering them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instant of wickens its strappings or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more distributed than she found them all americans who strive to blast in the man and who but three months before had been all the way to the angel of life he was declared to be in bed for every 13 in the place and his intrigues all honored with the title of seduction had been extended into every phrasemans family everybody declared that he was the quickening to the man and the world and everybody began to find out that they had always disrupted the appearance of his goodness elizabeth who had not credited about half will instead be believed to have to make her fall out of the string of her sisters ruin more certain and he can gain who believes still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never more entirely despair but they were something with them mr gardiner left longborn on sunday and she stayed whose wife received a letter from me they told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to grace church street it mustve been it had been the episcopment in boston before he arrived at but without gaining any satisfactory information and that news now became into an fire at all the principal hotels in town as mr benithauded possible that might come from to one of them from their first coming to london before they procured lodgings mr gardiner himself not expressed any success from his message but as he felt a little weaker in it he met to his assistant in pursuing it he added that mr benithauded seemed totally disemointed as if he lived on the and promised to write again very soon there was also a postspirited visit that and im addressing the criminal course for to rely on the funder to offer some of the young mens ideas from the western know and i dont know if i must any relationship with the next one hell be right there to know whats her account he has now concealed himself if there were anyone that wanted to apply to the probability of gaining such a coup of fact it might be of a central country but presently we have nothing to guide us from a forced or will i dare say to everything in his power to satisfy us on his head but on second thought perhaps easy to tell us what relation he has now lived better than any other person elizabeth was at no loss to understand somewhere this difference to her also or due to seated but it was not in the power to give any information of so status factor and nature as the compliment he heard she had never heard of this happened had any relations except the father and mother both of whom had been dead many years it was possible however to see what the opinion would be like sure might be able to ignore the information and then she was not very sad when he expected the application was a something full of truth every day at longborn is now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected the arrival of letters is a brand object of every mornings information who letters whatever of truth or that is to be heard theyre completely familiar with it and every city in may its likely to be some reason important but the four people were again from his department a letter arrived to their father from a different quarter from mr collins which as jane had received their eruptions opened all that came for him and his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosity to letters were looked over there and read it like wise it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to can go with you on the previous reflection you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from heart to true be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and myself seem to be sympathized with you and all your respectable family and your present distress which must be a big bitterest part because proceeding from a heart is said which no time can renew no arguments shall be wanted on my heart that can alleviate so severe on this fortune but if my comfort you under certain stance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parents mind the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison to this and it is more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose that my dear charlotte informs me that this my sentuism is a behavior in your daughter as proceeded from a heartfeet degree of indulgence though at the same time i will not consider it from your self and mrs bennett i am in fine to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity thats so early in age how so will that maybe you are previously to be fitty in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins but like once by lady catherine and her daughter she will never have related to your fair the way that we look at you and after having a good thought step in one daughter they be inferienced with the fortune already ever for duty as lady catherine herself on the sunday night says looking at themselves is such a family and this consideration makes me more over to reflect on mental satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all of your sorrow and disgrace let me then advise you your sir to control yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection forever and leave her to reach the fruits of her own being as exact as that i am your sir etc etc mr diana you are not right then when you are at the same time you are not forced to look at her and then you had nothing of a pleasant nature to send it was not known that the victim had a single relationship between the kept up and the connection and it was such an enemy that nobody would know his sorrow for you can say has been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them there was no one therefore who could be put about that likely to be any music and in the rest of the day of his own finances there was a very powerful motor for secrecy and addition to his fear of the stability of the relationship for headless and fired that he had left the gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount how forced to believe that more than a thousand pounds between us is very clear of his expectations thats right in the owed a good deal in town but his debts and honor were still more formidable this could burden him but he did not attempt to conceal these particular from the longborn family james heard them before a gamestrum she cried this is wholly unexpected ive had not my idea of it mr gardiner added in his letter that the mindexpect to see their father at home on the following day with his saturday brendas spirit was by the illicit steps of older endeavors he had given to his brother and moms injury a few of her parents gave her a hand a new victim and a new do what a vocation makes to jobs for the advice of them for continuing their pursuit when mrs bennett was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before perhaps as he coming home and without poor lydia she cried sure he will not leave london before he has found them who is to fight with them and they can marry her if he comes away as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and the children should go to london at the same time that mr bennett came from it the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to london mrs gardiner went away from all the complexity about elizabeth and her garbage here friend and had attended her from that part of the world his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs gardiner had formed of there being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing elizabeth had received none to change her and that could come from her belly the president unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the loneliness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjected from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that she know nothing of her sea she could have borne the dread of lydias into me somewhat better it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two when mr bennett arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophical composure he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters encouraged to speak of it it was not till the afternoon when he had joined them at sea but elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that who should suffer about myself it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it you must not be too severe upon yourself reply to elizabeth you may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so prone to falling to it no lizzie let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame im not afraid of being overpowered by the impression it will pass away soon enough do you suppose them to be in london yes where else can they be so well concealed and lydia used to want to go to london at a pity she is happy then set her fathers diary and her residence there will probably be a celebration then after short silence you continue lizzie i bear you no ill will for being sacrificed and you are obliged to be left with which is a very new event show some greatness of mine they were interrupted by misvenant who came to touch her mothers teeth this is a parade deprived which does one good it gives such an elegance to misforge him another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my nightcap in carghering down and give as much trouble as i can for perhaps i may be for it till kitty runs away lizzie ive found the wrong way proper stead to the front please the first ever good of brighton i would be his better than lydia you would go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as hes formed for 50 pounds no kitty i have at least learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it no officers ever to enter into my house again no even the past proven billet all will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters and you are never to stir out of force so you can prove that you have spent 10 minutes of every day in a rational manner kitty we took all the starts in a serious life began to cry well well saidy do not make yourself unhappy if you are a good girl for the next 10 years i will take you to a review at the end of them and the chapter 48 this is a liberal recording all the books of recordings are in the public domain for more information or to volunteer please visit librivoxorg recorded by designer brighton prejudice by jane austen chapter 49 two days after mr bennetts return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the public behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards me and completely when she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennett a big pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in the hopes she might have got into the news in time so i took the liberty of coming to ask what you mean here we have heard nothing from time do you remember me quite interesting with things like this one can you know that there is no return from the master from the forgotten book he has been here this half hour the master has had a letter the way around the girls two years ago to get in to have time for speech they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room the father was an either and they were on the point of speaking him upstairs for their mother when they were met by the bugger he said if you are looking for my master mum he is going towards the little cops upon his information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was delivered because hearing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock jane who was not so light more so much in the habit of running as a little of a soonladbewind while her sister hunting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out though for power what news what news have you heard from my uncle yes i have had a letter from him by express well and what news does it bring good or bad what is there of good to be expected said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps he would like to read it elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand jane knock him up we did a loud said the father for i hardly know myself what it is about grace church street monday august 2nd my dear brother at last i am able to send these untidings of my knees and such as upon the hill i hope it will be the satisfaction soon after he left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were the particulars i reserved till we meet it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both when it is i have always hoped cried jane they are married i have seen them both they are not married no can i find there was any intention of any self but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement a third equal share of the £5000 secured among your children after the disease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of lying her during your life £100 per annum these are conditions which considering everything i had known hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you i shall send this by express that note my may be lost in your answer you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr wickham circumstances are not so helpless as they are generally believed to be the world is interesting to know about this and i would like to say that you will be shown it in more even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my knees in addition to the wrong fortune if as i conclude will be the case you send me full power to act in your names throughout the hill of this business i will immediately give directions to hagueston for hiring a proper settlement there will not be the smallest occasion for you coming to turn again therefore stay quiet at longborn and depend on my diligence and care send back the answer to the spouses requirement and be careful to write explicitly we have decided best that my knees should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve she comes to us today i shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on use it etc at will gardener is it possible probably needs a good fortune at finished can it be possible that you will marry her what can the knots have undergirding them as we sort in let me twist her can i feel it farther can you place it later and have the answer for better why do you need to go through no but it must be done soon wish earners stay with you to then in treating him remember time before he wrote oh my dear father she cried come back and write immediately consider how important every moment is in such a pace talk me right for you sejane if you dislike the trouble yourself i dislike it very much but it must be done and so saying he turned back with him and walked towards the house and may i ask sejane is a bit but it hurts as if there is a must be quite a complied with i am only ashamed that he got me so little and then most married yet he is such a man yes yes he must marry there is nothing else to be done but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle was laid down to bring it about and the other how am i ever to bring it come on come on pogging what do you mean so i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia and so slight attention as 100 years during my life and 50 years ago that is very true there was a couple of her to me before he said and this charge and something is good and i am with must be my uncle then i was good man i am afraid that i will never let him go i am so sorry for not doing this no i said that father what can be said to be the father in less than 100 years old i should be sorry to think so with him in the very beginning of our relationship i think he is not in pain i think he is the only one that was fathers decision to be the father he is the benefit made no answer and each of them deep in the thought and can be silent to their reach the house the father then went on to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast room and they are really to be married for at least as soon as they were going to say it was all of us how strange this is and for this we are to be thankful the vicious marriage smaller is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice it will lead you out i comfort myself with thinking you are by jane what is that if you have not a real regard for her there was kind of uncle who has been something towards clearing him i kind of believed that 10000 parents or anything like it has been a father he was children of his own and made up no how could he spare half ten thousand parents if you were ever a little on this you can expect it to be in the beginning and how much he said it on this side and i was just scared we shall exactly move what he has forgotten his son for them because wickham has not six kinds of a son the kindness of my uncle and i can never be required it they are taking a home and the hoarding her there is a personal protection and pants the stuff is sacrificed for her a bond with her and you will be blessed with kind of another hobby by this time she is actually with them with such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never be there to be happy what a new thing for her and she first sees my aunt we must endeavor to forget all that has passed from either side subchain i hope and trust that we get be happy his consent to me to marry her is a proof of will be that he has come to a right for her they are moving to the factory instead of living and i thought of myself that he would set his way quietly and given so much more money and i make that passed in for his forgotten their conduct has been such if i believe this as much as you know i i know anybody can ever forget it is useless to talk of it it never occurred to the girls that their mother was no longer like the girl i just happened they went to the lazerie therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it into her he was voicing and without raising he said call you reply just as you see may we take my uncles letter to read to her take whatever he like and get away elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went upstairs together mary and kitty were both with mrs bennett one communication would therefore do for all after a sight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud mrs bennett could hardly contain herself as soon as jane had read mr gordon was hope of lydias being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vocation to know that her daughter would be married was enough she was disturbed by no fear for her validity no humble by any remembrance of her misconduct my dear dear lydia she is delighted for the indeed i shall see her again she will be married at 16 my goodkind brother i knew how it would be i knew he would manage everything how alone to see her at a seated wick and turn but close to what he says i will write to mrs the godmother about interacting mrs maria run down to your father and ask him how much he will give stay safe i will go myself ring the bell kitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet her eldest daughter endeavored to give some relief to the violence of these strong people by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr garden has behaved the aladdin more what we must attribute is this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness we have persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wicken with money well quite her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle if you had not had a family on his own i and my children must have had all his money and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except if you present well i am so happy in a short time i shall have a daughter married mr wicken how well it sounds and she was only 16 last june my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so will dictate and you will write for me we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslim and cambric and what shortly after dated some very painful orders on jane there was some difficulty the spaded letter made from her fathers letter one day she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual other schemes too came into her head i will go to meriton that she as soon as i embraced and felt a good good new letter to my daughter in it another come back i can call them lady lucas and mrs long kitty run down at all of her carriage an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do anything for you and meriton oh here comes hild my dear hill have you heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and usual all have a bowl of punch to make merit her wedding mrs hill began instantly to express her joy elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly to refuge in her own room that she might think was freedom poor lydias situation must have best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful she felt it so and though in looking forward miles the rational happiness no worldly prosperity if you just expect it for her sister in looking back towards the head of the field only two hours ago she felt all the advantage of what her had been end of chapter 49 we quoted by the zena in valetra to sample two thousand five this is elizabeths father he had a father for the family and he had a family for the family please visit the birth box dr boy recording by ilyne by jane austin chapter 50 and 51 mr bennett had very often reached before this period of his life that as he spent his own year he was getting laid by the others and the better position of his children and of his wife if she survived him he now wished it more than ever had he done his duty in that respect maria and he not have been indebted to her uncle but whatever of honor of her one of the most worthless nunmen in great britain to be her husband my thenhavestic and a proper place he was seriously concerned by the cause of socalled damage and the cause of authority of the soul of sense of the brotherinlaw and he was determined that the cause find out the sense of the situation and he was determined that he was the one who had to be the mother of the soul the first incident had been carried a commonlossheld teacher to produce this four of course they were to have a son a son was to join in playing off the nfl as soon as he should be a baby and the widow and younger children who buy that means hes a writer for five daughters successfully entered the world and the other son was to come and this has been it for many years after lydias birth had been serving that before this event had a last been disparate of but it was then too late to be saving this has been it had no turn for a finding and the husbands law of independence had a loan to benefit his death five thousand pounds a settled by marriage articles and this has been it and the children but in what proportions it should be divided among fullatter depending on the will of the parents this was one point the regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and this event can have no hesitation in the seedings which opposed the performance in terms of grateful knowledge for the kindness of the mother those trespass most concise he then delivered on paper perfect affirmation all that was done and as well as to fulfill the engagement that had been lifted he had never before us opposed that to look and be to build on her daughter he would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as wide as she doesnt know her he was spiritually concerned that she would be able to use her at a hundred times a day poor but with her bored and popular knowledge and a continual sentence in mind that it passed to her through her mothers hands lydias extensions had been buried a little within that better would be done with such trifling and assertion on the side too theres another very wellconservant the relationship between the two have a real trouble and business cost and the first transfer of the rage that had produced her as a kind of machinemade old old doll can naturally deter and draw its form or influence theres a lot of a scene thats found poor though is the real toy and the case cant resist hes tricked and execution he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send him as his child she could have been stuck to threefeet house and with the portion she could if she was an apehood it was born in the latter with this emblazoned to be sure it would have been far more for the advantage of the controversy of his lydia at that time or as a happier selfpunitial than to be the criminal role thats in this department but there was much to be talked of in mary and the goodincheat vicious but her old doing i took her seat at the floor from all the spiteful days in america lost the little of her spirit from these changes of circumstances because of the threat to husband her misery was considered a threat to her theres a fortnight since mrs ben had found her but on this property again the pursuit of her mistake and in spirits of the husband no sense in a chain gave a damn to her trying the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since james 16 was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts however had been holy on those ten minutes but i was looking at her find husband and father and servant she was this researching through the neighborhood so it was a process of relating to her daughter and the bathroom ultimately was not the only one that was in her room she was looking at her husband and fit they taught her husband to fit if the door rings could fit or it could not fit then when we large her but after her i did not fire her mother for my husband and i was to pull this large because it adds a thread but her husband allowed her to pass on to that and pull out from her so that her man but when i had to find he said to me he said well you take any of all of this husband whos thinking about her i was thinking about her right i was thinking of one of her but i was

his manners have been through and from his judgment in connection and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of great and important so no such happening marriage can now teach the admiring multiplicity to commute real solicitors or those a union of a different tendency and proceeding to possibility of other assumed to be formed in a family how wickham and lydia were to be supported in palable independence she could not imagine but how little of her men have to belong to her couple so were only brought together to the passion of the longer and ever to she could easily conjecture mr gardiner has two more to get into his brother to mr benins acknowledgment he briefly replied that the assurance of his weakness to promote the welfare and any of his family and concluded with the truth that the subject might never be mentioned again to sensible prayer to the broader listen form them mr wickham and resolve and putting them in the mission he was greatly my words to introduce us yes as soon as he narrates his footsteps on and i think you are agree with me and you can see that the world is fairly advisable both on his account and my name is it is mr wickhams attention to going to the regulators and among his former friends there are still some more able to learn to assist him in the army he also promised of an entity in general legitimate now quoted in the north it has an advantage to have so far from his part of the secret to come to the fairly and i hope among his and people where they may entrap the character to preserve they will both be more prudent i written to colonel horster who is one of our press operations and he requested to be well satisfied with various predators in mr wickham and the abiding with the trunks of speeding plates for which i invite you to answer and then give yourself the cover of character to make sure that you are just so very good working i can let myself enjoy it with a pudding pudding commission we are given an all in his debt i hope that these days not the secret im sorry we have our directions and all will be completed in the lead they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longborn and i am stan finns guardian and i need to be very desired with a senior law before she will be in the sound of him she is well and thats to do the thing we will know about him he always consider him in the dark night mr bennett and his daughters saw all the adventures of the things we will have come to sure as far as mr gardiner could do but mrs bennett was not so well but he is being set over the memorial just to ensure expected most pleasure and pride but she is not living this is a very disappointing and the sign is such a pity that really she is taking her regiment which means it cant be with everyone and has so many favour she is so far under this sport such a thing it was quite tough and disunderered and there are several of the young men who treat the throughout the country but the officers may not be so present in general i dont know she is not in fact but such a mighty considerate of being a living into a family again because that is what i thought of the most the same day first i asked her to take it the gentleman was the big relicator the executive sisters spirit and consequence the chief should be noticed on a marriage by her parents her children so

sandwich and breakfast in the summer smiles that the kids in the south atlantic have declared for the three doors and theyve been looking for the kids in the same place the goddess the longdistance and the ancient the name of the voice was heard in the vestigal the door was thrown open and she ran into the room her mother stepped forward and brazed her and welcomed her with rapture her hand had been an affectionate smile to wikham to follow his lady and which then both joyer within the line there was no doubt of it there was a few minutes for that as he opened her then it was not quite so cool to be alone the fountain is rather gained in austerity and its very certainly open his lips its easy to show us of a young couple and deep this map to overcome all this best was discussed with me i mean this senate is shocked the idea is still unkind and unkind its not a true secret the mountain that can graduate when that time came they all sat down they couldnt even let them go they took some of the assembly out of the ocean and i served for the last that it was a great well to teach them make them a lot of yall more stressed than the sun but its not meant for all they still could the night is carried away in the air and the darkness the sky is the only way to be able to see the other the sky is the only way to see the other and a ratherям who wrote an off a smile is ideas to preach over their life but its just not something he should tell you you should come out but not somebody else could show you its just not human he is the only self who drawn over the makes of music for our customs of spirit man and you control us foot but we shared our names there was no bond this caucus the bride and mother can either primarily and the winner who happens to sit in the elizabeth began acquiring after his acquaintance in that neighborhood but the good thing that he is she felt very unable to eat or hear the past he seemed to venture to happen to not raise in the world nothing is attached to the left hand i really feel that im not going to do it the sisters will not have the good of you for the world only think of it as being three months she cried since i went away the teams put a court murder to clear and let their then things in the time could be gracious and i went away im sure i had no idea that i would come back i thought it would be very difficult i thought it would be a bizarre dangerous step these are the perfect stress that it would be there but she never heard of nosought anything that she chose to be sensible she would be continued oh mom do you see the secret thats more or more known today i was afraid i might not be over to growing boldly in this puricle so i was determined we should know it and so i let down the side im sure i might be there im sure i might be there im sure im there in the dark so then i might see the ring and then ive bowed and smiled like anything i always would prefer it no longer she got up and ran under the ring and turned her more told her to put her in the house and put it on the spot she then joined them so we met her in the living room thanks for her walk a few of those right there and then a photo of her sister she left her home i took her place now and he missed her there because im not even there theres not to be suppose that time of good lydia that embarrassment can make sure her been so holy free at first for easy good spirits and peace she longed to see mrs phillips and we could see all that other labour and the girls do have called mrs griffin but each of them and then the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring and both to be married and to make her still on the true husband and they were all in time to get back this evening and the two think of her husband is not here to try me and she and my sister saw anything i and her sister had to find her husband then a hard day to go that is the person what a pity that she was now weve been a hard day very true and we thought had my way of thinking but my dear lydia im just going to all like to go and search her now and ill tell you what to do now im mad that thing is nothing right now i should like it all the time even father and sister come down to see her she should be at me class and i have an answer i just say that we have some balls and i just play you part it up and down ill tell you that if you dont let anything to the mother and then when you go back you may be wondering when im too advice to change her and id say i should have passed him to write on the code and then to his over i thank you for my share with the baby so it was nice breddy not particularly like her but ive been in her sense whats the point there wasnt anything not to be name about her it was her working in the scene shes commissioned a call about london and it was to join the legend at the end of the report no one in this is ben weve heard about her story we can search her and she made the most of the time by visiting her now with a daughter and having very busy parties at home these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circles even more desirable to such as dip pink and such as the wrong we can see fact in familiar its just what was the correct subject to find not equal to the obvious for him its very significant that her present on her station was decided from the reason of her but there are local and have a draw on her its very fair about the other its not quite fair its not fair to show local her at all and she knocked out serving that is quite his mandatory by the stress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the only one now who just helped her to be a part of her family lydia was excessively fond of him people who are deal with him and are very afraid no one needs to be put in competition with her but everything best in the world and she is sure he will work out her own business and anybody else will want to one morning soon after their arrival she was sitting with her two older sister she said to elizabeth in the zee i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe you were not by when i told mom and the others all about it im not sure if youre used to hear out it was managed no really replied of zeeb i think there cannot be two little setup of the subject no you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were married yeah except her husband because wickhams lodgings were in that parish and it was subtle that we should all be there by loving a pop my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have done quite distracting and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking wait this is she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in ten and i was thinking they proposed it might seem like im alone to know whether he would be married and he would be well and so we breathed the sitan as usual i thought it would never be over for by the value id understand that my uncle and aunt were hoarding pleasant all the time i was with them and youll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors thought it was there at poor nights not one party or a school or anything we sure run into this matter however to the fields well and so just as a carriage came to the door im called away upon business for a man mixed with stone and then you know when ones figured together theres no end of it for instance i can imagine that im able to do for my uncle and us to give me a bit and i think were beyond the hourly we could not be married all three but luckily we can die for ten minutes five and we all set out forever i would collect an accurate certificate preventive going to by the need not to put off from the stagot and money down as well mr stoffsy do you feel it over and ever raise me oh yes he was come there with me can you know but gracious me i quite forgot i am on to have said a word about it i promise them so faithfully if youd never wake him up say it was to be such a secret if it was to be secret to be i say not in the middle of the sea and make it from the bottom of my head yet oh so i didnt say the elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you now questions thank you siddolita for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then we can be angered and thats the courage of that elizabeth was forced to put it out of the power to prevent him from getting married but whats the point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information mr garcia been at mr streets wedding he was exactly the scene and exactly a moment before he apparently used to do and missed himcation to go he captured us to the meaning rusted and wild far into a brain but she decided to find the mind those at best cant have a place in contact with another right two months were probably she could not bear such a sense and this was the scene shed appear wrote a short letter to her aunt she couldnt remember what we had planned could it look compatible with cqc with like a new family she may readily comprehend she had but my career asked him as to make a new household person and can help you with any of us and to her to be speaking a stranger to our family to have been amongst you at such a time playwright and stippin and let me understand it unless it is her very cogent reasons to name and seek and see which videos used to be necessary and then i must endeavor to be satisfied with it not that i shall yeah i should be listening and my dear aunt could you back tell me in an honorable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and strategies to find it out jane stalk had some savanna were not allowed her to speak she was with privately about what lydia had left for all of the stuff was rather told her to peer at what her increase would to see an insatisfaction shed rather be without a comfort and we could not this is a libri box reporting all libri box recordings are in the public domain for more information visit wwwsdorg recording by sherry klober pride and prejudice by jane austin after 52 the elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her lover as soon as she passed away to her she was no sooner in possession of it than the ring and the little folks which were as least likely in the interactive she sat down on none of the ventures and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter he did that it did not convey a denial grace could speak september 6 by doing this i have just received your letter and shall devote this full morning to answer and by the same letter in the finale will not comprise that i have to tell you i must confess myself to her as far you are from future i did all expect it and you dr king angel however for i am in need of what you know but i did not imagine such a desire to be in the essence of your own side if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impurities the author is as much surprised as i am in and nothing that could be the purity of heart you concerned would have allowed me to act as he is done but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit on the very day of my coming home from london you are on and had a most unexpected visit mr grasikar and mr karatek and mr

and the virus and which remain debido to sweden which uses a lot of labor remains which featured in music and labor for frustration and her parents would love or can part her home the generous lady took her to the home and she was living fine and confessed that he had before thought itd be me thing to make his actions open to the room his character was to speak for itself he told that there for his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy him evil which he had thought on by himself if you had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him he had been some days in town before he was able to discover and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolve in the following us there is a main word series and this is young who was some time ago that the mystery of this story was just used when he tried on some cars of this story but he did not say what she ran for the large house in edward street and has 152 results by different margins this is young who has been in the middle of the street and he went to her friends intelligence after him as soon as he got to town but it was two or three days before he did that hand over what he wanted she would not be free of trust and to close without driving and collapsing but she really didnt know where her friend was to be found but then indeed he had gone to her on her first arrival in london and she had been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her at length however our kind friend called kier the wish for direction he saw the clip and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia his first object referred to heath knowledge had been to persuade her to get her present to squeeze his attrition and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go but he found lydia and her second name was dr william for sure she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham she was sure they should be married sometime or ever and it did not much signify when since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure an expedient marriage which in his very first conversation with heath wickham he easily might have never been able to find him he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some of the same debt of honor which were very pressing and scoopled not to lay all that your consequences would be he said and her own fault is a problem he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could contact her very little about it he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should not have nothing to live on mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once though he had not found him at him to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage but he found him reply to this question that was in still cherished he had not been affected shortly making his fortune by marriage is some other country under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation that he immediately believed they met several times where there was much to be discussed welcome of course wanted more than he could get but at night there was reduced to being reasonable everything being settled on and on mr darcys next step was to make your uncle a quintitive with it and he first found the best opportunity to be clear and fine but mr darcys question was that he was not a good father but he was not a good father but he was not a good father to be the best father and therefore rather than his son he would not have been a good father and therefore rather than his son he would not have been a good father he did not leave his name until the next day there was only long but a gentleman who cried on his knees on saturday he came again he followed his dad and then said or he had a good father together and then i sang it was not a father but our visitor was very obstinate i sang to the reason that obstinate is the real defective as character after all he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the fault of all thats the best to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would not struggle to have such a different family they gathered together for long times this was more than i did the gentleman or maybe concerned him at the zoo but at last your uncle was supposed to be old and instead of being allowed to be a news to his knees was forced to put up with only having the public opinion which went so near against the family but i really believe your mother disloyaled with the family of our family this is a required and explanation that would rock and not be both and this is a place where it was too but listen this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people this debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon hers and raised commission for fixed the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given a bow it was only him to his research and want the proper consideration that with his character had not been understood and consequently that he could not be in the zoo and all his thoughts perhaps that is some food to this but i doubt that in case he was a loser i can be answerable for the love but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have healed it if we had not given him credit for another interest in me affair the love is for his wife and that company but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish i believe i have now told you everything it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you in this pleasure lydia came to us and with some head clonced in the mission to the house she was exactly what you had been with a new home in her picture but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her when she stayed with us if i had not received by james leder last wednesday that her friend got done from home as a giftonly ever kiss with it and therefore at i now tell you you can give a nofetched pain i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious marriage representing her all the victims that were she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought out her family if she had heard me it was fine good luck but i am sure she did not listen i was sometimes quite capable but then i got connected my dear and was looking for her and for theres a sad future so far mr dahl is in his country in his return and as lydia and my wife a twoyearold and died with us in his dream and his loved ones so it was her story will you be very angry with me my dear if i take this opportunity to say what i was never going to let the soldier go how much i like me his behavior to us has in every respect in his dream as when we were in barbarat his understanding in his dreams all feeds me he wants nothing but a little more lifeenvious and that if he may be very clearly his wife may teach him i thought him very small he hardly ever mentioned to me but slimes seem to function i forgive him if i had been very presumed or at least do not punish me so far its too excuse me from thinking i shall never be quite happy do i have been all ran apart a lowfaintlylooking with a nice little pair of things with me the very thing i am so happy to be here i am so happy you are very sincere and valuable the practice that i have left you in this regard will be a part of some of the next in which it was difficult to determine whether to start your eight dream or the great of her the hope and any sudden sisterfriends who transitor to have the gifts of what used to be our similar dream during the four of the sisters marriage which she appeared to encourage as an assistant to the student who is very intelligent and at the same time i gave her to be chosen and the kind of other vision the thing and right the hint of success to be true to the college of sisters daughter to achieve an answer to all the trouble and the recognition of gender and sisters relationship that he had done it for her but it was a whole shortly checked by other considerations and she seemed out that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her so when we knew what i would be confused as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as a force against relationship with her rather than love we can every kind of pride must be rolled from that connection he had to be sure done much she was ashamed to think how much but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had never known that he had to say anything and both of him and his yourself as his principle in do seem she could perhaps believe that the meaning of such a reality for her might exist in her relationship and thats what she meant to be it is painful its seeming painful to know that there were other obligations to be presented together with seeming of eternity for overest you are too much living after character everything is in oh how hard you are to achieve value over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed to the worlds end but herself she was hungry but she was proud of him proud that when it caused a compassionate honor he had been able to get the better of him she read a book that he has been engaged in in the end it was hardly enough but it pleased her she was even sensible of some effort but mixed with the regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her own burden had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisting to her stardusty and herself she was roused from the seat in her reflections by someones approach and before she could strike you to an exit her she was overtaken by the face i am afraid i interrupt your story very randomly because you are so cute for answers and it certainly does she reply to the smile but if theres not fully that the interruption must be unwelcome i should be sorry indeed if it were we were always good friends and now we are better true are the others coming out i do not know this is been it in lydia are going in the carriage to marry her and so my dear sister i find it from her infant that you have actually seen pennurally she replied in the affirmative i almost envy you the pleasure i will take her to my child for us i will take you to my way to newcastle and you saw the old postkeeper i suppose poor reynolds she was always very fond of me but of course she did not mention my name to you yes she did and what did she say that you had gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well at such a distance of that you know things are strangely misrepresented certainly he replied byding his lips elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy and talmas we passed each others couple times i wonder what he can be doing there perhaps a parent would be scared elizabeth would look at it it must be something particular to take from there at this time of the year im very pleased to hear her say its been her way i thought i understood from my gardeners that you had the sc introduced us to a sister thank you thank you very much i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very glad you liked her i hope she will turn out well i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age did you go by the village of kympton i do not recollect that we did i mentioned it because it is the living which i ought to have a most delightful place excellent person at home it wouldnt suit me in every respect how should you have liked you if you say this exciting as well i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not to repyne but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the quiet and the calm the question life would have answered all my ideas of happiness but it was not to be did you ever hear dark sea mention the circumstance when you were in kent i have heard from a party which i thought as good that it was left to you conditionally only and it will not affect the future yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you were in you may remember i did hear too that there was a time when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be a trend that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly you did and it was not fully without foundation and i remember that i told you on that point when first you talked to the person they were not always at the door at the house so she had not passed to get rid of them and unwillingly she only said it with a good human experiment she was a little bit more confident in understanding do not let us quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of one mind she held out our hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantly and he hugged a new heart of milk and they entered the house end of chapter 5 to 2 chapter 53 mr higgin was saved perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never had been distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet the day of his and lydias departure soon came and this has been it was forced to submit to a separate show which has her husband by mom and his enter into her stream of their all going to be canceled it was likely to continue at least at 12 months oh my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again oh lord i dont know not these two or three years perhaps right to me very often my dear as often as i can but you know mary women have never much time for writing my sisters may write to me they will have nothing else to do mr higgins goodbyes will much more affectionate than his wife he smiled looked handsome and said maybe pretty things he is the finer fellow said mr bennett as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw he simmers and smurks and makes love to us all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even servo him with his himself to produce a more valuable son in life the loss of a daughter made mrs bennett very dull for several days i often think that she that there is nothing so bad as parting with ones friends once he was so far away with our friend this is the consequence i see on that of mary and her daughter it must be the benefit of her son that you are other than her son im single it is no such thing lady of death not leaving because she is married but only because her husband is rich you see her all did that have been here and she would not have gone so soon but the spirit was conditioned which this event threw her into the shorty of the heat and her mind opened again to the application of hope but all the children in the house were going to be there the housekeeper and mothers place that was seen in the area that the children had been thrown at the master she was hanging in the area tree to shoot her for several weeks this is brandons place in the digits she looked at the jinn as well and she figured out how to turn it well well and so much to be doing is coming down the system but this is where its going well so much to the father not the father though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see me again but however he is very welcome to come to never feel if he likes it and who knows what may happen the father is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it and so is it quite certain he is coming you may depend on it we tried the other and this is the first lesson i would to last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true he comes down on thursday at the latest very lucky on wednesday she was born to the butchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple ducks just fit to be killed miss bennett had not been able to hear of his coming without the food but now as soon as they were alone together she said i saw you looking at me today as even when i meant to and i saw the present is heard and i know i have to address but dont imagine it was from in my silly cause i was only confused with a moment because i felt that i should be looked there i do agree that the news does not expect me to either get rid of your old pain i am glad of one thing that becomes alone because we saw some rest of them not that i prayed at my side but i did other peoples remarks i was not sure if i could not know what to make of it but she was not seen in the dark she was not seen in the dark she was not seen in the dark but she was not seen in the dark but she was still far from the past and she was able to find the perfect balance of the past but this time she was missing or she was able to come and out yet it is hard to find the past but she was not seen in the dark but she was able to find the perfect balance of the past or she was able to find the perfect balance of the past but she was able to find the perfect balance of the past and she was able to find the perfect balance of the past and she was able to find the perfect balance of the past and she was able to find the perfect balance of the past and she was able to find the perfect balance of the past and she was able to find the perfect balance of the past and she was able to find the perfect balance of the past the subject is that you saw the image on this screen its been a while since you told about the time you met it it was not that hard to understand and she was ever missed it when you saw the screen and you were half the way to the mirror oh wow oh wow the time is still a little too sweet its a little more than half of the past but it was a little more than half the past and i did not understand that you were standing at the mirror it was very strong to go to the mirror how absolutely necessary such an extent of your being in the past i dont think you were in the mirror or she was able to imagine it she can edit it out this slide that she is thinking if you know how to exercise the slide she is not used to it she knows what you did i will not spend my hours in an afternoon i will never spend my hours in a time that go away from that again so all i know is that it will be a vulnerable view if you do not wait for him but however that shamp prevents my asking me to die here on the turning we must have mrs long and the golden soon that will make 13 with our cells so that will be pretty easy im too different here can so find this resolution she was the better able to bear her husbands in ceremony though it was very more defined to know that the leaders like us who was living in the past started to get better if they didnt as the case was arrived in the mirror i became interested that it comes out of the turn for her sister it would be nothing i could think i knew that the second thing but i can hardly tell if you were at that strategic target my mother knew it but she did not know no one can know how much i suffered from that she said having shall i be in this story i never feel this older i wish i could say anything to please you because ive never felt it ive never felt it ive never felt it you must feel it and in the future started scratching the future its too suffer its denied me because you have always so much mr domingo by mr bennett has a detailed system instrument he tries to have the only child in the world that has created a particular mechanism … acceptable state of fact that it has a moronsunwing dangerion due to a very cruel stringent alarm in the world to the extent that looked for a nuclear synth andformation but象 mechanism… it was not yet the release of theseeletcrafts and rifles to those countries i thought it was material i think its a good thing its a good thing its a good thing its a good thing its a good thing its a good thing its a good thing its a good thing its a good thing its a good thing its a good thing its a good thing its a good thing its a good thing its a good thing its a good thing its a good thing its good its a good thing thats hard really good its a good relationship mr garth sem and so it does ive got well in bender mr greens will always be well compared to this chair but as i never say that hes very concerned jane looked at her as a goodvisitprey and concerned she knew but really like hes a badvisit and therefore felt that he awkwardnessed witness which must be her sister it will seem here almost when the first time after the scene has explored her letter both sisters were uncomfortable enough each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother jumped on a christmas 기다�see and her resolution to be settled for her only as a sister without being heard that either of them but at least the text sources of an esigness which could not be suspected by jane and jane she had never yet had heard of her sister she had never heard of her sister she had never heard of her sister she dreamed that she could only learn which could be used as she had been and she met her sister and her daughter the child was born and she couldnt remember she was a person who could be seen and she was a person who could be seen and she was also a person who could be seen at least if we can go and just as what jane felt for the pain first all mission at his coming every coming can never be too long and volunteers seeking her again was almost people to what she had known and first witnessing his alternate behavior in garbisham the color which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with a medicinal glow and a smile of delight added musted her eyes and i as she thought about scootsie wow thats exactly what she was saying thats all we have to do that she will not be secure let me first see how shes behaving so she will then be earning enough for her position she sat in tenting at work striving to be composed and without doing anything with that but i to an interesting aspect of the truth and to the face of her sister as the servant has a position for her girl stainless the little tailor the mutual but more sedate than others of her had expected on the gentle lines of her color increased yet she has seen some kind of color that needs and with a profile of behavior easily leads from instant to instant or yet elizabeth said as little to either a civility would allow and sat down again to her work within egonus which it did not often command she had ventured on a one glance at grossy he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in her picture than she had seen her at her belly but perhaps she could not in her mothers presence be what he was because of her uncle and aunt it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture they made she had life by seeing for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both of these and dressed he was received by mrs bennett with its ability which made her two daughters ashamed especially when the craft of the book holds its her own hands her might answer her courtesy and her first friend elizabeth i take you by me can you move back her mother old to the latter of the first generation of her favorite daughter from eurimiri who was hurt in distress to a misplacer degree by a distinction so pale upon darcy after an aspiring occur how mr mrs barrier did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely anything he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in darbisher there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself but now several minutes he asked the best we need to sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she is often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object at the ground more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they had last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so but i expected to be otherwise said she yet why did he come she was in no humor for conversation with anyone but himself and in his hand she had hardly courage to speak she inquired after his question for continuing she went away said mrs bennett he readly agreed to it i began to be afraid you would never come back people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at my promise but however i hope it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighborhood since you went away miss lucas is married and settled and one of my own daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers and within the time and the career i know both have was not put in as it ought to be it was only said lately george wilson to look to the event without there being a similar set of her father or the face where she lived or anything it was my brother gardners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it did you see it its been really replied that he did and made his congratulations elizabeth there not lived up to rise holler mr garth looked at him or she could not tell it is the delightful thing to be sure to have a doctor well married continues her mother but at the same time mr beehoy it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me they are gone down to newcastle they please fight not for it seems and they are to stay i do not know how long his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard his leaving the militia and have his been all into the regiment thank heaven he has some friends though perhaps lots of many of us he deserves elizabeth he knew this to be leveled and he sovers in the insecurity of shame that she could have argued with her son it drew from her however he was ready to leave which nothing else had shown that truly done before and she asked me whether he meant to make any stay in the country as a pleasure a few weeks he believed when you have killed all your own birds mr beehoy said her mother i thank you for coming here and shoot as many as you please on mr beehoys manner i ensure he will be fast and happy to oblige you and will save all the best of us elizabeths misery increased at such a necessary such a vicious attention we are the same fair of prospect to arise that present as have flattered than a year ago everything should be so at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself and mens for moments of such painful confusion the first wish of my heart said she turned herself is never more to be accompanied with either of them their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such preciousness as this let me never see either one or the other again yet the misery for which years have been heard after a no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister we can though the admiration of her former lover when first speaking to me he had spoken to her vocal looking but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natures and as unaffected so not quite so chatty jane was anxious that no different should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever but her mind was so busy in gauge that she did not always know when she was silent when the gentleman rose to go away mrs benel and i have heard her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to die and have been called you are quite illfizzed in my guess but when you went to tell us which room you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned i have not forgotten you see and i assure you i was very disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business benel and today mrs benel had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay in dining there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think anything less than two courses would be good enough for a man on her chair and the chapter this is the three this is a liprovacs recording all liprovacs recordings are in the public domain for more information or to volunteer please visit

other words to dwell without interruptions on those subjects that must dead in them more mr darcys behavior astonished and vexed her why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all she could settle it in a way to get her pleasure he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come bitter if he no longer cares for me why silent teasing teasing man i will think no more about him her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister we joined her with a cheerful look which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly oh jane take care my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now i think you are in very great danger making him as much in love as ever it did not see the gentle men again until tuesday then this has been it in the meanwhile who is giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humor and common politeness of bingley and half an hours visit had revived on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longborn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas for bore to invite him to sit by herself on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happen to smile it was decided he placed himself by her elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friends he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy and she not seen his eyes like a little bit of a mercy with an expression of halfflafing alarm his behavior to her sister was such during dinner time as she showed her admiration for which so more vivid than primarily persuaded elizabeth that upliftfully to himself janes happiness and his own would be speedily secure though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behavior it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast where she was a no cheerful viewer districtarcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them he was on one side of her mother she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did her mothers ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind and she would at times have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of family she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together at the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more conversation than the mere ceremony of salutations and the resentments anxious and unneasier the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentleman came was weary some endall to jegree that almost made her uncivil she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure will be in the midst of the pandemic if he doesnt have come to me then said she i shall give him up forever the gentleman came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas beladys had routed round the table where miss bennett was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee he was so close at confederacy there was not a single vacancy near her who could admit of a chair and on the gentlemans approaching on a moor said no whisper the moon sheds from the parties and in determined we went none of them through it theyre seeing a walkaway to another part of the room she followed him with her eyes and viewed everyone to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same moment there is no indignity so appalling to their feelings she was a little revive moreover by this bringing back this coffee for himself and she seized the opportunity to say is your sister at the time of the list yes she wont remain there to live at all and quite alone have all her friends left her this is anna slys with her the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to be merged with her he might have better success he stood by her however for some minutes inside of this and at last on the young ladys whispering to elizabeth again we walked away when the tea thing were removed and the hard tape is placed the ladys all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall as victim to her mothers capacity for whisk players and in a moment after seated in the rest of the cardinal she now lost every expectation of pleasure they worked and fined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hold but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessful in as herself this is better to design to keep the two netherful gentlemen to suffer but their character is unlawfully ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity to entertain them while girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day i think everything was passed up on commonly while i was sure the dinner was as well pressed as any eye ever saw the venison rose to too much herring and everybody said they never saw so fat upon him the suitcase was fifty times better than what we had at the end of this last week and even this fantastic knowledge that the cartridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french footsleeves in my gear chain i never saw you looking greater beauty mrs long has said so too her eyes were whether you did not and what do you think she said besides on mrs bennett we shall have her at another field at last she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good or freecare as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behave girls and not at all handsome i like them for digisly this is bennett and short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of things with behavior to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humor were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennett to elizabeth the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we may often meet again elizabeth smiled lizzy you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies me i assure you that i have now learned to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having to wish beyond it i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection it is only that news plus greater sweetness of address and strong desire of generally pleasing than any other man you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment how hard it is in some cases to be believed and how impossible another but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge that is a question which i hardly know how the answer would all love to instruct that we can teach only what is not worth knowing forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidants end of chapter 54 this is a libravox recording all libravox recordings are in the public domain for more information or to volunteer please visit libravoxorg reading by annie coleman in st louis missouri on january 16th 2006 pride and prejudice by jane austin chapter 55 a few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits mrs bennett invited him to die with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere next time you call said she i hope you shall be more lucky he should be particularly happy at any time etc etc and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them can you come tomorrow yes he had no engagement at all for tomorrow and her invitation was accepted with a lacquerity he came and in such very good time but the ladies werent done of them pressed in red mrs bennett was regarded firm in her dressing gown and with her hair have finished crying out my dear jane make hasten hurry down he has come mr bingley has come he is indeed hey case make haste here sarah come to misspen at this moment and help her on with her gown never mind mrs lizzies hair we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went upstairs half an hour ago oh hang kitty what will she do with it come big quick quick where is your sash my dear but one for mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening after tea mr bennett retired to the library as was his custom and mary went upstairs to her instrument two obstacles of the five being thus removed this has been at stat looking and blinking at a elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mama what do you think you get me for what am i to do nothing child nothing i did not want to get you she then sets still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her intrigue that she would not give into it in a few minutes mrs bennett half opened the door and called out this is the idea i want to speak with you elizabeth was forced to go we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall kitty and i are coming upstairs to sit in my dressing room elizabeth may know its him to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall so she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawing room mrs bennetts schemes for this day were ineffectual bingley was everything that was charming except the confessed lover of her daughter his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the illjudged efficiessness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with her forebearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs bennetts means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband after this day jane said no more of her indifference not a word has put to all the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed and the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy returned within the stated time seriously however she felt tallerly persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans concurrence bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennett spent the morning together as had been agreed on the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or discuss him into silence and he was more communicative and must eccentric than the other had ever seen him bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs bennetts invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes but on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her unopening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the heart as it engaged in earnest conversation and had this ledge no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all their situation was awkward enough but hers she thought was still worse not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again from bingley who as well as the other had set down set up the roads and was for the few words to her sister ran out of the room jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest preacher in the world tis too much she added by far too much i do not deserve it oh why is not everybody as happy elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a war of delight which words could but poorly express every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said called a present i must go instantly to my mother she cried i would not want any account to trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself he has gone to my father already oh lizzie to know what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family how shall i bear so much happiness she then chases the way to her mother who had purposely broken up the cards party and was sitting upstairs with kitty elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which nfar was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and relaxation and this said she is the end of all of his friends anxious circumspection of all his sisters falsehood and contrivens the happiest wisest most reasonable end in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose where is your sister said he hastily as he opened the door with my mother upstairs she will be down in a moment i dare say he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister elizabeth honestly and worthy express her delight in the prospect of their relationship the shook hands with great cogeality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of theficity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition of jane in the general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of mispenance mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsome or than ever kittys tempered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon mrs bennett could not be ever consent or speak her apparition in terms more than after satisfied her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour but when mr bennett joined the next hopper this voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was not a word however past his lips in illusion to it to their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you you will be a very happy woman jane went to you instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness you are a good girl you were five and then a great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled i have not a doubt of youre doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income i will not so impudence or thoughtlessness and money matters with the unparkinable in me the exceed their income my dear mr bennett cried his wife where are you talking of why is four or five thousand a year and very likely more then addressing her daughter oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i cant get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into heart for sure last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together oh he is the handsomeest young man that ever was seen whicken movie all forgotten jane was beyond competition her favorite child at that moment she cared for no other for younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness who she might in future be able to dispense mary petitioned for the use of library at another field and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter bingley from this time was of course a daily visit to her longborn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbor who finnaed enough to feste had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur in the absence of jane he always attached himself to a misadvent for the pleasure of talking at her and when bingley was born jane constantly sought the same means of relief he has made me so happy said she won evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town less spring i had now believed it possible i suspect he has much reply elizabeth but how did he account for it it must have been his sisters doing they were certainly no friends and his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have come so much for evan to eat justly in many respects but when they see me as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again so we can never be watching once for our threetodd that is the most unforgiving speech that elizabeth said i ever heard you utter good girl it would be best to indeed deceive you again the tooth of miss bingleys pretended regard which you believe at lizzie that when he went to town less november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being in different would have for fencing his coming down again he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty this naturally introduced a panagyric from jane on his dividends and the little value we put on his own good qualities elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving part in the world she knew there was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed pride jane oh lizzie why am i thus singled for my family and blessed above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but such another man for you if you were to give me 40 such men i could never be so happy as you the longawaited representation of your goodness i never can have your happiness no no let me ship for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another musk or tolerance in time the situation of affairs in the longborn family could not be long a secret this has been and was privileged to whisper it to mrs phillips when she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbors in mariton the benets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be more out within this fortune and look chapter 55 this is a lovely box with me all of our box of

satisfaction to the door of the stern or woman of visitor intern that was late in the afternoon they were of course on ten minutes as a fathers but their astonishment has grown their expectation and on the part of miss bennett and kiddly that she was perfectly aware tonight even in fear to whether it is a bit late she entered the room with an air more than usually enrages may no other reply to her as a beside the tissue and a slight impenetuous in the hand and im not sure if i can contact her and also have a better time elizabeth could mention her mother and her ladyships entrance and when

painting of sometimes and ever and teaching others the same method between people in the world with стала water and water cubes i am the pass paper that will beations to drown me let me tell you the next thing anything and where i am from you are not wrong you make up time names fine the advice and tragedy of so near relation might settle every doubt keeping his promise shed come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand i shall then give her my career as a magician ill be worshiped as kings to see if you satisfy the form of a girl then you might have obtained my affection as a friend i shall soon cease to regret it the surprise of the rest of the family im hearing you a visitor had been thats very great what they ablagingly satisfied in with the same kind of supposition which had appeased misvenants curiosity and scarierly spent a much decent subject the next morning as she was going downstairs she was met by her father he came out of his library with a letter in his hand liging sitting i was going to look for you come into my room she followed him through her and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her and her story and her son the such a family to be able to sit there and write a letter in the house it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated that this may all the court of her best relationship she followed her father to the fire tonight and it goes back down and then i knew this thing about it was one of this astonishingly seen way as a principal concerned yourself you ought to know its context i did not know before that i had two daughters in the very fragile room but we can gradually get you out of very important and complexed the color now rushed into a visibates cheeks and the instantaneously the chair was being a letter from the knife wall and still at the end and she was undeturned but it must be pleased that we explained this after all or if you could have said that it would have been so when a father continued he looked conscious young ladies have a great literature in such an analysis i think i made fun even more sense to discover the name of him this is that this is the name of his kid from his to carlos and what can he have to say something very much to the purpose of course he begins with congratulations on the approaching natural of my eldest daughter i wish it seemed he has been told by some of the good nature of gossiping in the business i shall not stop what relates to yourself is his promise every class offered you the sincere congratulations of his and myself i was happy with it but you now add a short point on the subject of the matter i wish we have been a fathers son and im not a father of this i know i know ill give you an older sister as a son im the chosen partner of the four when he is a great woman im the chosen partner of the four when he is a great woman i think hes the best of the three i know hes the best of the three everything in the class of the goal of this decision the three when the school fourth the two those are the twove that one make them close to the partners and the work endorses a goes ahead and family your own past none i said fakelaughs and theyve committed was intended my voice is starting to wake them close to you my woodenwifes children will stay if i cant find my right hand for a grand im really excited i have recently imagined that its an act really i can remember im not sure mr dicey you still are now is he highpitched oh because hes such a goodstop anymore he was a stripper of our paintings hes an annual given of four about the great time you know mr dicey you never books at a woman but to see a blumish and who probably never looked at you in his life it is admirable elizabeth tried to join the fathers present room but he always works one by two by his never had his work been directed more than it was so goodalternally are you not to hurt it ah im not to hurt it oh yes i mean after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage her relationship was made she immediately revealed it she knew it she knew it but she knew it whether it became a period then the misfortune of some family of the egyptians on the part of my cousin she would never give her concerns to what she turned to so despite so much i thought it might be she used to tell me she didnt hurt her maybe a rare of what they are about and not run hastily into her there but she was not in the business mr collins moreover aunt i am sure that i would like my cousin lydia a sad business has been so well hushed up and im not a business and thats not clever theyve left the duties of my station a refrain oh a married it was an encouragement of advice and im not a single one but im not a single one but im a single one and im a single one and im a single one and im a single one and im a single one and im a legitimate advice and im an director of longburn i should very strongly as to the post i dont think i should give this a thought of straightup but get your attention into your sight or allow their needs that is a notion of christian forgiveness the rest of this letter is only about his dear charlotte situation and his expectation of a young olive branch but listen you did not look as if you enjoyed it you were not going to be a musician i hope and pretend to be a fronted at an hour point but what do we live but to make sport for our neighbors and to laugh at them in our own turn oh christ im a successful woman but it is so strange yes that is what makes me think i think fixed on any other man it would have been like this but it is perfect in different ways and your point is just like make it so delightful be absurd im not just like a bomb in a fire i would not thought that your bad mr collins is for a sponsor but anythings in it no when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even in realworldly as much as i value the impudence from the prophecy of my sin im very busy whats a lady captain about this footballer did she call to a future concerned to this question his daughter replied oh me with a laugh and as it had been asked her that the musicians decision she was not distressed by his repeating it elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear to be a little nervous it was necessary to laugh and she would rather not laugh father has proven what is funny her body set of mr darcys indifference and she could do nothing but perhaps wonder at such a warrant of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his sin too little she could have been too cute and the type of footballer said the courted by susan huss took you to paris this is a liberalvax recording all liberalvax recordings are in the public domain for more information or the volunteers please visit the liberalvaxorg recorded by ian coleman and st louis miserie in january 2006 pride and prejudice by jane austin chapter 58 instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth have expected mr darcy to do who was able to bring darcy with him to longborn before many days had passed after lady catherines visit the gentleman arrived early and before mrs bennett had timed tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread namely who wanted to be alone with jane how is there all walking out it was agreed to mrs bennett was not in the habit of walking mary had never stared at him but the remaining five set off together bingly and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid from the top elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same they walked towards blue pieces because kitty wished to call upon mary and as elizabeth so no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on what came alone now it was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said mr darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings and not how much i made people in the new years i can no longer help thanking you for your unenemified kindness to my poor sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge you how greatfully i feel it for it known to the rest of the family i should not have merely my own gratitude to its friends i am sorry exceedingly sorry for why darcy and its owner surprised and emotion did you ever have been informed of what may and a mistake in light have given you an easiness i do not think this is far from you so i am ready to be trusted you must not blame my aunt kitty is thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest until i knew the particulars first thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and there are so many modifications for the sake of discovering them if you will thank me here applied let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which let me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them believe i thought only of you elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word after a short pause for companion added you are too generous to triple with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject forever elizabeth feeling all of the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced yourself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to wish he eluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assured says the happiness which this reply produced was such a see had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt the lie will to view his over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her feelings which improving of what importance she was to him made this affection every moment more valuable they walked on without knowing in what direction there was too much to be gone and felt instead for attention to any other objects she soon learned that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and their relate her journey to longborns its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling in fatter through our every expression of the letter which in her ladyships apprehension peculiarly noted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her in death to obtain death promise from her nephew which she had refused to give but on luckily for her ladyship its affected exactly contrary wise it taught me to hope said me as i had firstly ever led myself to hope for her and you enough for her disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly elizabeth colored in last as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scripple and abusing you to all your relations what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusation for illfounding formed on mystic and premises might be eager to you at the time had emergent for severe stroke or it was unparadable i cannot think of it without a warrant we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame and as to that evening as elizabeth im not with neither of strictly examined will be irrefutable but since then we have both i hope improved in stability i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself a recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months and its impressively painful to me youll improve so wellapplied as shell never forget had you behaved in a more gentle andlike manner those reoverds you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have been returning but with some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice im certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong and impression i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in this way im so happy that you brought me back to all of it with every proper feeling im sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do it all and im sure you that i have long been most part of the issue in this mercy mentioned this letter did it said me did it soon make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed i knew said me that what i wrote must be a bepain but it was necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter from one part especially the opening of it which i shouldnt read or having the power of reading again i can remember some expression which might just make you pay to me the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but very rare i think thats not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies when i wrote that letter i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself i think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who rose and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy of what i think only for the past as its remembered and gives you pleasure i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment of rise in the memory is not a philosophy but what is much better of innocence but with me it is not so painful recollection will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled and its been a selfish being all my life in practice so not in principle as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles to let to fall them in pride you can see unfortunately and only son for many years and only child i was spoiled by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged on those taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from 8 to 8 and 20 and such i might still have been but for you dearest lovely is elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt with my reception you showed me how insufficient for all my pretentions please a woman worthy of being pleased i do then persuaded myself that i should to be the i had or for you think of my van as me i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses my manners must have been in thought but not intentionally i assure you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong how you must have hated me after that evening hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction im almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at kimberly you blame me for coming no indeed i thought nothing but surprise your surprise cannot be afraid of a mind and be a noticed by you my conscience told me that i deserve no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than i do my object then replied to her saying was to show you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproves had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduce themselves i can hardly tell and i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you he then told her at georgianna to lighten her pointys and up her disappointment added sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learned that this resolution of following her from darbys year in plusker for sister had been formed before he put it to the end and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend she expressed her gratitude again that it was too painful as subject to each to be dwelled on farther after walking several miles from a leaderly manning and too busy to know anything about it we found a last on a family in my watches that it was time to be at home what could become a mystery thingly in jane was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it i must ask whether you were surprised said elizabeth not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen that is to say i guess too much although he explained that the term she found that it had been pretty much the case on the evening before my going to london said me i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make one woman under her parents and parents who served in the apartment the surprise was great and he remembered what the slightest suspicion i told him more over that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done and her sister was indifferent to life and as i could easily pursue that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together elizabeth cannot help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend did you speak from your own observation as it should when you turn the closest to her loved one will me only for my information must spring from the phone of a narrowly observant during this few visits which i had made me make here that i was convinced of her affection and youre sure in so that i suppose carried immediate conviction to him its is i think that its most unaffected in the modest most evidence that prevented his defending on his own judgment and so it interests the case but is right or not and make everything possible what was obliged to conduct one thing which for a time and not for a industrial offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been entitled for him on his last point but i had no and purposely i would not allow him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded as to no longer than he remained in any doubt that his sisters sentiments he has heartily forgiven me now elizabeth long the two observed that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his words was invaluable but she took herself she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at and it was rather too early to be there and then to see happiness of bingley which of course was given here crying in prejudice and jane austen chapter 59 my dear lizzy my familiar opinion of bingley she was a question that she was a bit recently but she was a bit busy with bingley she entered their room and from all the evidence she was never set there she had only just a reply that they had come about to choose beyond her own knowledge she followed as shes heard but neither that nor anything else but within the suspicion of the truth even as quietly one marks by anything extraordinary the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unignalance were silent her seat was not for this position in which happiness when her flow is immersed and elizabeth aged me and i confused and rather new than she was happy and found herself in the be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils for horror she anticipated for what you felt in the family in her situation that they know she was aware that no one might come but jane and even feared that with the others it was a disguise which had caused the alterment of the victim thats night she opened her heart to jane those suspicions were very far from this finished general evidence which she was absolutely incredulous here you are joking missy this cannot be engaged to mr darcy no no you shall not be seated i know it to be impossible this is a wretched beginning indeed my soul depends was on you and i am sure not to be else with the evening if you do not it indeed i am embarrassed as we are knocking back the time he still loves me and we are engaged jane looked at her doubtingly oh lizzy it cannot be i know how much you dislike him you know nothing of the matter that is all to be for god perhaps i did not always welcome someone as i can now and in such cases there is news of good memories unparalleled this is the last time i fell over the moment where i saw you you said its not look all amazing you said it again and also the form of a strange what happened anything to be so yet now i must believe you jane my dear dear lizzy i will do congratulate you can i ask you a second to give the question are you fine you are good at it i will be happy to be here i can be no doubt about it i decided to be here so already i am very happy to be here i hope you are happy please jane if you like to have such a brother i am very very much nothing to be there i dont remember all myself i am very glad if you consider it you have to be as impossible and do you remember from the flight home now i am very glad i am very glad i am very glad i am very glad i am very glad that you feel what you want to do oh yes you will only think that you are more of a husband can i tell you all what do you mean why i must confess to my love and better than i do vaguely i am a friend you will be angry my dear sister now be serious i want to talk very seriously let me know everything that i have to know how to be there will you tell me how long you have loved him i have been coming on so gradually i hardly know when you began but i believe i know a state that for my first seeing the couple grounds of time really i am not very happy to be here i am very happy to be here i am very happy to be here i am very happy to be here and she seems satisfied to be here i have a small little friends who have come to the doctor i am very happy to be here and then when that part of the day this has been nothing for their relationship now in whats happening such a thing for me this is happening inside i always tell them that you are here i am very happy to be here i must always have a feeling but now as being a friend and a friend i am very happy to be here there can be only things we end up in order to be here the lizzie you have been very slide very reserved with me how little did you tell me of what passed it to him really in limo too i owe all that i know of it too not to you who is the one who has pulled her to the motels of her secrets she had been unwilling to mention vingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend but now she would no longer conceal from her because she is sure in the days marriage i always acknowledge that her happiness spent in her secret the lizzie you must walk out with him again that he may not be in binglys way lizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient to proposal yet was really best that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet as soon as they entered they would look at her so expressly and she would get into the civil war as left no doubt that his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud this has been it if you know more lanes here about in which everything may lose your way again today i advise mr garcia and lizzie and kitty said mrs bennett to walk to open mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr garcia has never seen the view it may do very well for the others more glide bingley but im sure it will be too much for kitty wont you kitty kitty owned that she had rather stay at home garcias professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented as she went upstairs to get ready mrs bennett followed her saying i am quite sorry lizzie that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind me it is all for jane to say you know and theres no occasion for talking to him except just now and then so do not put yourself to inconvenience during their walk it was resolved that mr bennetts consent should be asked in the course of the evening elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her appearance of the man but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sons and she would be no more mayor that mr garnty should hear that her trap hers up for sure then the first vehement of her disaffovation in the evening soon after mr bennett withdrew to the library she saw mr garnty rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme she did not fear her fathers position he was going to be made unhappy and that it should

today on which mrs bennett got rid of her two most deserving daughters with what delighted cry and she afterwards visited mrs bingly and talked of mrs darcy maybe guests i wish i could say but a sick of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire and the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy and effect it was to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life so perhaps it was lucky for her husband he might not have relished domestic felicity and so unusual of form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly mr bennett missed a second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him optiner from home then anything else could do he delighted and going to pemberley especially when he was least expected mr bingly and jane remained at another field only at 12 months so near a vicinity to her mother and maryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affection at heart the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought in the state in a neighbor and took a dormitory chair and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness or within 30 miles of each other kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters in society so a superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid from the further disadvantage of lydias society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promising balls and young men her father would never consent to her going mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennett being quite unable to sit alone mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparison between her sisters beauty and her own who was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance as for wickham and lydia their dressers suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and possid before been unknown to her and in spite of everything was not wholly without hope the darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least did not by himself such a hope was cherished the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you so rich and we have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite many enough to live upon without some help any place would do of about 300 years but however do not speak to mr darcy about it if you had rather not yours etc as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavored in her answer to put an end to every intrudy and expectation of the kind such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expenses she frequently sent them it had always been evident to her that such an income is theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their once and he and this of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they change their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme there were always moving from place to place in quest of achieved situation and always spending more than they ought his affection for her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims of reputation which her marriage had given her though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeths sake he insisted him further in his profession lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingles they both of them frequently stayed so long that even bingles could humor was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hit to be gone miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropped all her resentments was fondre than ever at georgiano almost as attentive to darcy is here to four and paid off every overyear of civility to elizabeth pemberley was now georgianos home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see they were able to love each other even as well as they intended georgiano had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with nistana shes formerly not a lot a lively sport of men are talking to her father he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry her mind received knowledge which had never been forefalling her way by elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which her brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than herself lady catherine was extremely indicted on the marriage of her nephew and that she gave way to all the genuine brightness of her character and her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end but at length by elizabeths persuasion he was provoked over the defense and she collapsed over the region and after a little further resistance on the part of his arm her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she cant descend into weight on the midterm really despite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city with the gardeners they were always on the most intimate terms darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbys share had been the means of uniting them end of chapter 61 and and tried to prejudice by jane austen
