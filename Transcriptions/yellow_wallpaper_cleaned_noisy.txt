wwwvibilvalscom slash immature underscore indefinitely the yellow wall pit by charlotte perkins ginnon it is very seldom that mere ordinary people like john and myself secure ancestral halls for the summer a colonial mansion a hereditary estate i would say a haunted house and reached the height of a manic velocity without the asking too much of fate still i would proudly declare that there is something queer about it folks why else should it be let so chiefly and why have stood so longantimated john laughs at me across but one expects that in marriage john is practical in the extreme he has no patience with faith and in 10th part of the superstition and he snows honours honours honours was not to be felt and seen and put down in figures john is a physician and perhaps i would not say to a living soul of course with this his dead paper and i gradually left to my mind perhaps that there is one reason i did not get well vasted you see he does not believe i am sick and what can wonder if a physician of high standing and ones own husband a suresphrins and relatives if there is really nothing that matters with one but simply there is nervous depression a slight hysteria tendency what is one to do my brother is also a physician and also a high standing and he says the same thing so i take false faiths or false fights whichever it is and tonics and journeys and air and exercise and absolutely forbidden to work until i am well again personally i disagree with their ideas personally i believe that can heal work but its a slightly changed with doing me good but what is one to do i did write for a clowns body but it does exhaust me a good deal having to be so slay about it or else meet with heavy opposition i sometimes fancy my condition if i had less opposition and more society and stimulus the john says the very worst thing i can do is think about my profession and i confess it always makes me feel bad so i will let it alone and talk about the house the most beautiful place it is quite alone standing well back from the road quite three miles from the village and makes me think of english places that you read about where there are hedges and walls and gates that lock and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people there is a delicious garden i never saw such a garden large and shady full of boxborted paths and lined with longgrip covered arboras with seats under them there were green houses too but theyre all broken now there was some legal trouble i believe something about the house cohairs the place has been empty for years that spoils my ghostliness i am afraid but i dont care there is something strange about the house i can feel it i even said so to john when we were talking about him but he said what i felt was a drought and shut the window i get unreasonably angry with john sometimes im sure i never used to be so sensitive i think it is due to this nervous condition but john says if i feel so i shall neglect proper selfcontrol so i take pain to control my soul before him at least and that makes me very tired i dont like our room a bit i wanted one downstairs that opened on the piazza and had roses all over the window and such pretty old fashioned chants hanging but john would not hear of it he said there was only one window and not room for two beds and no near room for him if he took another he was very careful in loving and hardly lets me stir without special direction i have a scheduled prescription for each hour in the day he takes all care from me and so i feel basically ungrateful not to value it more he said we came here solely on my account that i was to have perfect rest and all the air i could get your exercise depends on your strength my dear said he and your food somewhat on your appetite but air you can absorb all the time so he took the nursery at the top of the house it is a big air room the whole fouryearold with windows that look always an air and sunshine glow it was nursery first and then play room and gymnasium i should judge but the windows are bought for little children and there are rings and things in the walls the paint and paper look as if a boys school had understood it is stripped off of the paper in great patches all around the head of my bed about as far as i can reach and in a great place on the other side of the room low down i never saw a worse paper in my life one of the sprawling flamboyant habits committing every artistic sin as the girl left confused the eye and followed pronounced enough to constantly irritate and provoke study and when you follow the main uncertain curves a little distance they suddenly commit suicide and the ones off and out really displeased destroying themselves and then purred out counteractions the color is repellent almost reported a silken unstomping extremely difficult by the soil turning the sun it is a dull that mowered in a bright softnonsense sickly silken 10 to millions no wonder the children hated it i should hate it myself i had to live in this room long there comes john i must put this away he hates to have my right over we had been here two weeks and i havent felt like riding before since that first day im sitting by the window now up in this atrocious nursery and theres nothing to hinder my riding as much as i please say black or strength john is away all day and even some nights when his cases are serious im glad my case is not serious but these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing john does not know how much i really suffer he knows there is no reason to suffer and that satisfies him of course it is only nervousness it does lay on me so not to do my duty in any way im into be such a help to john such a real rest and comfort and here i am a comparative burden already no one would believe what an effort it is to do what little i am able to dress and entertain another thing is it is fortunate mary is so good with the baby such a dear baby and yet i cannot be with him makes me so nervous i suppose john was never nervous in his life he left me so about this wallpaper at first he meant to repay for the room but afterwards he said that i was letting it get the better of me and that nothing was worse for a nervous patient than to give way to such mancies he said that after the wallpip was changed it would be the heavy bed stare and in the barred windows and in the gated the head of the stairs and so on you know the place is doing you good he said and really dear i dont care to renovate the house just for a threemonth rental then do let us go downstairs i said there are such pretty rooms there then he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little piece and said he would go down to the cellar if i wished and have it quite washed into the bargain but he is right enough about the beds and windows and things it is an area and comfortable room as any one need wish and of course i would not be so silliest to make him uncomfortable just for all who will im really getting quite fond of the big room all of the men who are in the paper not one window i can see the garden those mysterious deep shaded arbors the riotous floor fashion frames and bushes are made to me i dont have another blanket i can rub my hand and i dont need private cloth belonging to the estate there is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house i always fancy i see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors but john is crushing me not to give away to fancy movies he says that with my imaginative power and habit of story making im nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manners of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency so i try i think sometimes that if i were only well enough to write through the world it would relieve the press of ideas and rest me but i find i get pretty tired when i try it is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my work when i get really well john says we will ask cousin henry and julia down for a long visit he says he would as soon as put fireworks in my pillowcase i still let me have those stimulating people about me now i wish i could get well faster but i must not think about that this paper looks to me as if it knew what a vicious influence it had there is a recurrent spot where the pattern lowers like a broken neck and two bulbous eyes stare at you upside down i get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the everlastingness up and down in sideways they call and those absurd unbooming eyes are everywhere there is one little place where two breaths didnt match and the eyes go all up and down the line one little higher than the other i never saw so much expression in an ordinary thing and we all know how much expression we have i used to lie away from each other i get an moment or pain and terror out of blank words and came furniture the most children could find in a toy store i remember but i kindly winked the knobs of our big old bureau used to have and there is one chair that always seemed like a strong friend of i used to feel that if any of the other things looked too free i could always hop into that chair from the same the furniture in this room is no worse than in harmonious power but we had to bring it all up from down stairs as opposed when this was used as a playroom we had to take the nursery things out and no wonder i never saw such radicals and the childrens had made here the wall of aim was us its torn off in spots and its thick and closer than a brother they must have had perseverance as well as hatred then the floor is scratch and gouge and slender the plaster itself is a dugout here and there and this is a great hidden bed which you probably found in the room looks as if it had been through the walls but i dont mind it a bit when its a paper there comes johns sister such a dear girl she is and so careful with me i must not let her find me right away she is a perfect and enthusiastic housekeeper and hopes for no better profession i barely believe she thinks it is the writing which made me sick but i can write for you and see her long way off from the windows there is one that commands a raid a lovely shaded wine in the room and one that just looks off over the country a lovely country too for the great alms and all the metals this wall paper has a kind of subpadding and a different shade a particularly irritating one you can only see it in certain lights and that clear of them but in the places where it is infated and where the sun is just so i can see the strange provoking formless of a foodie it seems to scook about behind that silly and conspicuous but designed theres sister on the stairs well the fourth of july is over the people are gone and i am tired out john thought it might do me good to see a little company so he just had mother and mary and the children down for a week of course i didnt do a thing jimmy seems to have everything now but it tied me all the same john says if i dont pick up faster he shall send me to wear a mitchell in the fall but i dont want to get there at all i had a friend who was in his hands once and she says hes just like john and my brother only more so besides it is such an undertaking so far dont feel as if it was worthwhile to turn my hand over for anything and im getting dreadfully fretful and careless i cry at nothing and cry most of the time of course i dont win john this year or anybody else but when i am alone now i am alone a good deal just now john has kept in town very often by serious cases and jimmy is good and lets me alone when i want her to so i walk a little in the garden going down that lovely lane sit on the porch under the roses and lie down up here at good deal im really getting fond of the room its quite good perhaps because it dwells in my mind so i lie here on this great and movable bed it is nailed down and follow that pattern about by the house it is a good and gymnastics on the show i start i say at the bottom down in the corner over there what has not been touched and i determine for the thousandth time that i will follow that pointless pattern of some sort of a conclusion i know a little of the principle of design and i know this thing was not arranged on any laws of radiation or alteration or repetition or symmetry or anything else that i never heard of it is repeated of course by the breadth but not otherwise looked at in one way each breadth stands alone the bloated curves and flourishes i kind of debased romanesque with delirium trimmons go ladling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity but on the other hand they connect diagonally and the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror like a lot of wallowing series in full chase the whole thing goes horizontally too at least it seems so that exhaust myself and try not to distinguish the horror thats going in that direction they have used a horizontal breadth for a freeze and that adds one deflated confusion there is one end of the room where it is almost intact and there when the cross light stayed in the low sun shines directly at the planet i can almost fancy radiation after all the interminable grotesque seemed to form around the common sensor and rush off and hit along the plunges of equal distraction it makes me tired to follow it i will take a nap like this i dont know why i should write this i dont want to i dont feel able and i know john think it is a serr but i must say what i feel and think in some way it is such a relief but the effort is getting to be greater than the relief half the time now i am awfully lazy and lie down ever so much john says im less of who is my stream and he has me take the fun liver oil and lots of tonics and things to say nothing of ale and wine and rare meat dear john he loves me dearly and hates to have me sick i tried to have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day and tell him not to wish you had let me go and make a visit to cousin him and julia but he said i wasnt able to go nor able to stand it after i got there and i did not make out a very good case for myself for i was crying with flyer finish it is getting the great effort for me to think straight just this nervous weakness i suppose and dear john gathered me up in his arms and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed and sat by me and led me to a tired my head he said i was his darling and his comfort and all he had and that i must take care of myself for his sake and keep well he says no one but myself can help me out of it but i must use my will and self control and not let any silly fence run away with me theres one comfort the baby is well and happy and does not have to occupy this pierce where weve got a horrible hair if we had not used it the blessed child would have what a fortune and escape why i wouldnt have a child of mine and impressionable little thing live in such a room for worlds i never thought of it before but it is lucky that john kept me here after all i can stand it so much easier than a baby you can see of course i never mentioned it to anyone i need to rise but i keep watching it all the same there are things in that paper that nobody knows i never will behind that outside pattern the gym shakes it clear every day its always the same shape only very numerous and it is like a woman stepping down and creeping about behind that pattern i dont like it if its i wonder if i begin to think i wish john would take me away from here im so happy im so happy im so happy im so happy im so happy im so happy im so happy im so happy im so happy im so happy im so happy im so happy im so happy im so happy im so happy so i kept still and watched the moon line and that humiliating wall paper till i felt creepy the fake figure behind it seemed to shake the pattern just as if she wanted to get out i got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper did move and when i came back john was awake what is this little girl he said dont go walking about like that you get cold i thought it was a good time to talk so i told him that i really was not gaining here and that i wished he would take me away what do i do i at least will be up in three weeks and i cant see how to leave before there are pairs and not done at home and i cannot possibly leave town just now of course if you were in any danger i could and would but you really are a better deer whether you can see it or not i am a doctor deer and i know youre gaining flesh and color your appetite is better i thought really much easier about you i dont weigh a bit more said i nor is much and my appetite may be better in the evening when you are here but it is worse in the morning when you are away bless her little heart said he would a great big hug she shall be a sick as she pleases but now lets improve the shining hours by going to sleep and talk about it in the morning and you wont go away i ask clearly why how can i dear it is only three weeks more and then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while ginny is getting the house ready really dear you are better better in body perhaps i began and stopped short for he set up straight and looked at me with such a stern repurchable look that i could not stay another word my darling said he i beg of you for my sake and for our childs sake as well as for your own that you will never for one instant let that idea into your mind there is nothing so dangerous so fascinating to a temperament like yours it is a vault and foolish fancy can you not trust me as a physician when i tell you so so of course i said no more on that score and we went to sleep before long he thought i was asleep first but i wasnt and lay there for hours trying to decide whether that front pattern and that back pattern really did move together or separately on a pattern like this by daylight there is a lack of secrets a defiance of law that is a constant irritant to a normal mind the color is hideous enough and unreliable enough and infuriating enough but the pattern is torturing you think you have mastered it but just as soon as you get well under way and following it turns back some result and there you are it slaps you in the face knocks you down and tramples it on you this is like a bad dream the outside pattern is a florid arabesque reminding one of a fungus if you can imagine a toad stool enjoys an interremitable string of toad stools budding and sprouting in endless convolutions why that is something like it sometimes there is one market peculiarity about this paper i think nobody seems to notice that myself and that is that it changes as the light changes when the sun shoes in through the east window i always watch for that first long straight rim it changes so quickly that i never can quite believe it that is why i watch it all the way by moonlight the moon shines in all night when there is a moon i wouldnt know it was the same paper at night in any kind of light in twilight candlelight lamplight and worst of all by moonlight it becomes bars the outside pattern i mean and the woman behind it as plain as can be i didnt realize for a long time what the thing was that showed behind that dim sub pattern and now i am quite sure it is a woman by daylight she is sedued quiet i fancy it as the pattern that keeps her so still is so puzzling it keeps me quiet by the hour i lie down ever so much now john says it is good for me and to sleep all i can indeed he started to have it by making you lie down for an hour after each meal it is a very bad habit i am convinced for you see i dont sleep and that cultivates you to sleep if i dont tell them im awake oh no the fact is im getting a little afraid of john he seems very clear sometimes and even ginny hasnt been super cool looking it strikes me occasionally just in a silent type of hypothesis that perhaps it is the paper i have watched john and he did not know i was looking and coming to the room is suddenly i am the most innocent excuses i have caught him several times looking at the paper i caught ginny with her hand on it once she didnt know i was in the room and when i asked her it was quite it felt very quiet for us the most restrained manner of possibly what she was doing with the paper she turned around as if she had been caught stealing and looked quite angry asked me why i should frighten her so then she said that the paper stained everything it touched she had found mellow smutches on all my clothes and joints and she wished me be more careful did not that sound innocent but i know she was studying that pattern and i am determined that nobody should find out that myself life is so very much more exciting now than it used to be you see i have something more to expect i am going to do it better and i am more quiet than i was ginny is so pleased to see me improve he laughed a little the other day and said i seemed to be flourishing and he is quite of my wallpaper i turned it off with a laugh i had no intention of telling him it was because of the wallpaper he would make fun of me he might even want to take me away i dont want to leave now until i have found it out there is a week more and i think that will be enough i am feeling ever so much better i dont sleep much at night for it is so interesting to watch the developments but i sleep a good deal in the daytime in the daytime this tiresome and perplexing there are always new shoots on the funnest and new shades of yellow all over it i cannot keep counting them though i have tried conscientiously it is the strangest yellow that wallpaper it makes me think of all the yellow things i ever saw not beautiful ones like buttercomps but old foul bad yellow things but there is something else about that paper the smell i noticed at the moment we came into the room but with so much air and sun it was not bad now we have had a week of fog in the rain and whether the windows are open or not the smell is still here it creeps all over the house i find it hovering and dying and scolicing in the power of hiding in the hall while i am waiting on the stairs it gets into my hair even when i go to ride if i turn my head suddenly into prizes there is that smell such a peculiar odor too i have spent hours in trying to analyze it to find what it smelled like it is not bad at first and very gentle but quite the subtlest most enduring odor i have ever met and this damp weather it is awful i wake up in the night and find it hanging over me it used to disturb me at first i thought seriously burning the house to reach the smell but now i am used to it the only thing i can think of is that it is like the colour of the paper a yellow smell there is a very funny mark on this wall to load down near the mop board a street that runs around the room it goes behind every piece of furniture except the bed a long street even smooch as if it had been rubbed over and over i wonder how it was done and who did it and what they did it for round and round and round and round and round and round it makes me dizzy i really have discovered something at last they are watching so much and not what a change of set i have finally found it out the front pattern does move and no wonder the woman behind shakes it sometimes i think there are great many women behind sometimes only one and she calls around fast and her crawling shakes it all over then in the very bright spots she keeps still and in the very shady spots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard and she is all the time trying to climb through but nobody could climb through that pattern it is strange also i think that is why it has so many heads they get through and then the pattern strangles them off and turns them upside down and makes their eyes white those heads were covered or taken off they are not in the past so bad i think that woman gets out in the daytime and i will tell you what i have seen her i can see her out of every one of the windows it is the same woman i know and she is always creeping and most women do not creep by daylight i see her on that long road under the trees creeping along and when a carriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines i dont blame her a bit it must be very humiliating to be caught creeping by daylight i always want to go on my creep by daylight i can do it at night for i know john looks to spec something at once and john is so queer now that i dont want to irritate him i wish you would take another room besides i dont want anybody to get that woman out at night but myself i often wonder if i could see her out of all the windows at once the turn as fast as i can i can only see out of one at a time and though i always see her she may be able to creep faster than i can turn i have watched her sometimes away off in the open country creeping as fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind if only that top pattern could be gotten off from the emerald one i mean to try it little by little i have found out another funny thing but i shot tell it at this time theres not a lot of trust being too much there are only two more days to get this paper off my belief john is beginning to notice i dont like to look in his eyes and i heard him ask jenny a lot of professional questions about me she had a very good report to give she said i slept a good deal in the daytime john knows i dont sleep very well at night for all im so quiet he asked me all sorts of questions too and pretended to be very loving and kind as if i couldnt see through him still i dont wonder he acts of sleeping in his paper for three months it only interests me but i feel sure john and jenny are secretly affected by it harrah this is the last day but it is enough john is to stay in town overnight and wont be out until this evening jenny wanted to sleep with me for the slifeing but i told her i should undoubtedly rest better for a night all alone that was clever but i really wasnt alone a bit as soon as it was moonlight and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern i got up and ran to help her i pulled and she shook i shook and she pulled and before morning we had peeled off the yards of the paper i stripped about as high as my head and half around the room and then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me i declared i would finish it today we go away tomorrow and theyre all moving all my furniture down again to leave things as they were before jenny looked at the wall in the basement but i told her merely that i did it at a pure spite of the vicious thing she laughed and said she wouldnt mind doing it herself but i must not get tired how she could treat herself but i am here and no person touches this paper but me not alive she tried to get me out of the room it was too patent but i said it was so quiet and empty and clean now that i believed i would lie down again and sleep all i could i was not to wake me even for dinner i would call when i would so now she is gone and the servants are gone and the things are gone and there is nothing left that great bedstead nailed down with a canvas mattress we found on it we shall sleep downstairs tonight and take the boat home tomorrow not quite enjoyed the room now it is arrogant how those children did tear about here this bedstead is fairly nod but i am as good to work i have walked the door and thrown them down to the floor i dont want to go out and i dont want to have anybody come in until dawn i want to stomp ive got a rope up here that even didnt did not come if that woman does get out and tries to get away i can tie her but i forgot i could not reach far without anything to stand on this bed will not move i tried to lift and push it until i was lame and then i got so angry i bit off a little piece at one corner but it hurt my teeth then i peeled off all the paper i could reach standing on the floor it sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it all those strangled heads and bulbous eyes and wobbling fungus gross just shriek with the origin im getting angry enough to do something desperate to jump out the window would be admirable exercise but the bars are too strong even to try besides i wouldnt do it of course not i know well enough theres steplight that is improper and might be misconstrued i dont like to even look out of the windows there are so many of those creeping women and they creep so fast i wonder if they all came out of that wall but i am securely passing now by my well hidden rope you dont get me out in the road there i suppose i shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes nice and that is hard it is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as i please i dont want to do that side i wont even if jing asks me to for outside you have to creep on the ground and everything is green instead of yellow but here i can creep smoothly on the floor and my shoulder just gets into that long smoother and more so i cannot lose my way why theres john at the door its no usual man you came open it how he does call and pound now hes crying for an axe it would be a shame to break down that beautiful door john dear said i in the generalless voice the key is down by the front steps under a planteringly that sounds dumb for a close he said i cant sit on the key is down by the front door under a planteringly and then i said it again several times very gently and slowly and said it so often that he had to go and see any god of course came in he stopped short by the door what is the matter he cried for gods sake what are you doing i kept on creeping just the same but i looked at him over my shoulder ive got out at last said i in spite of you and jenny and ive put on the ground i in spite of you and jenny and ive pulled off most of the paper so you cant put me back now why should the man have fainted but he did and ran across my path by the wall so that i had to creep over him every time end of the yellow wall paper i showed perkins villain recorded by alan noble thomasville
