read by chris garbage chapter one it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in root of life how have any good known the field of human such a man may be what has first entered in a neighborhood this truth is so well fixed in the world the surrounding families that he is considered the mightful property of some one or other of their daughters my dear mr benz said his lady to him one day i think heard that no field of park is let it last mr benz replied that he had not but it is returned she for mrs long has just been here and she told me all about it mr benz made no answer do you not want to know who has taken it try it as wife impatiently you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it this was invitation enough why my dear must know mrs long says that never the field is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england but he came down on monday and had chasened four to see the place i was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that he is to take possession of the nicholas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of the week what is his name bing he is married or single oh single my dear be sure a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls come soon how did affect them my dear mr benz the pilot is wife how can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marim one of them is that his design in settling here design not since how can you talk so but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send one himself which perhaps will be still better what as you are as handsome as any of them is to be in might like you the best for party my dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now when a woman has five grownup daughters sure to give over thinking of her own beauty and such cases in all of us are not just a much better than a good one but my dear you must indeed go and see mr binyley when he comes into the neighbourhood it is more than i engage for i assure you but consider your daughters please and establish them as a good person so really ladies look as i determined to go merely on that account for in general they visit and know you can and indeed you must go so it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not you are oversquiping as surely i dare say mr binyley will be very glad to see him and i will send him a few lines by you to assure him of my party consent as mary would whichever he chose of the girls by most people good word for my little lizzy i desire you will do no such thing this is not a big bet of me others im sure she is not half so handsome as jane no half so much you did but you always give a big preference they have none of the much to recommend the mit they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters mr binyley how can you abuse your thorn and shaw you didnt like in vexing me you have no compassion for my claw nerves can you stay with me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves they are my old friends ive heard you mention them with consideration these last 20 years at least you do not know what to suffer but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of 4000 in the year come to the neighborhood there will be no use to us if 20 such should come since you will not visit them to depend upon us my dear that when there were 20 i will visit them the end was so much to have quickness sochastic to make his wife understand his character her mind was less difficult to develop she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news chapter 10 mr binyleys mother the earliest of the nation was downstairs to be linked you had always intended to visit him then to be lost always assured his wife is sure to go until the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it it was then disclosed to the following man observing his second daughter lloyd intrimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope mr binyley will like it lizzie we are not in a way to know what mr binyley liked said her mother was sentfully since we are not to visit but you forget my mother said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long promised to introduce him i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two mrs foulow she is selfish but fit for woman but i have no opinion of her who no more have i said mr binyley no i would like to find that you will not depend on her serving this is been his name but to any point i am able to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters dont keep coughing so kitty for heaven sake the light burns in the heavens essence kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill i do not cough my own amusement replied kitty fretfully when is your next all to be lizzie tomorrow fortnight i so it is quiet my mother and mrs longs not come back to the day before so impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know himself then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr binyley to her impossible mr binyley impossible what i am most worried about myself how could it be so pleasant i know your circumstance but i am sure that your acquaintance is certainly very little one cannot know what man really is by the end of the fortnight little weeven of them she has somebody else will and after all mrs long and her daughters must stand with their chance and therefore as she will think of active acquaintance if you to climb your fist and would take it on myself the girl stared at her father mrs binyley said only nonsense nonsense what can be the meaning of that empathic exclamation right do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress this has laid on them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say you mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and we need great books and make extractors many wish to say so sensible but you know what how ram mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr binyley i am sick of the thing i have just tried to hear that why did you not tell me that before if i knew as much as i wanted this certainly would not have called on him it is very unlikely but as i have actually paid the visit he cannot escape the acquaintance the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs binyley perhaps surpassing the vest though when the first two months of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while how good it was in you my dear mr binyley but i knew i should persuade her to ask i will show you love your girls too and neglect such an acquaintance well how neat are you and he is such a good joke too then you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it now kitty you make coffers much as you choose it was the minute and as he spoke he left the room for tea with the rapture of his wife what an extent to far you have earned so she would have been rude i do not know how you will ever make a mens face kindness or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so pleasant i dont tell you to be making new acquaintances every day for your sex you would do anything lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr binyley will dance with you at the next hall oh sir lydia stop crying hello i am the youngest under the wall of the street the vest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr binyleys visit and returning when they should ask him to dinner chapter 3 not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject what sufficient to turn to walk from her husband in his set of slack to be described in mr binyley in genius suppositions and a distant smile is but he looted the skill of the more and they would not imagine the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas her report was highly favourable so william had been delighted with him he was quite young one of the hopes and hopes that he would be able to come before him he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party nothing more to light food to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lightly hopes and hope in his heart are entertained if i can but see one of my daughters have been settled in the field and all the others equally well married i shall have my family wish for them in a few days mr binyley returned him mr bennets visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library he had a good point on the mood to show up at the moment ive been happy he had heard much but he saw only the father the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs bennets plan for the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when it arts revived which the third is called mr binyley was obliged to be in town following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitations mrs bennet was quite inconserted she could not imagine what business he could have entailed so soon after his arrival in hartfordshire and she could have had a place for the old town following a place to arrive and never settled another field as he walked to me lady lucas quieted and fierce a little by stating the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and of a port soon followed that mr binyley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly the girls agreed over such a number of ladleers but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from london his five sisters had a custom and in the party entered the assembly it consisted of only five altogether mr binyley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man mr binyley was good looking in gentlemanlike he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion his brotherinlaw is to host nearly looked to the gentleman but his friend mr darsit soon ruled the attention of the room by his fine dull person handsome features noble name and the report toward the general circulation within five means of his entrance of his having ten thousand the gentleman pronounced him to be a fine figure man but they declared he was much handsomeer than mr binyley and he wasnt looked at with the motivation about half the evening till his men escaped to spaston which turned the tide of his popularity for he would discover to be proud to be a boss company and a boss being pleased and not all his largest and large men saving for half a million disembowel countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend mr binyley had soon made himself acquainted with all the books he would be willing to leave he was livid and unreserved danced every dance was angry to the poor close to early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield so he would be called to speak for themselves what a contrast between him and his friend mr darsit had only walked with mr darsit whilst with miss binyley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party his character was decided he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and everybody hoped he would never come there again amongst the most violent against him was mrs bellett whos disliked his general behaviour sharpened into particular resentment with his heavy slighted whitefurred alters elizabeth bennett had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to work to sit down for two yards and during part of that time mr darsit had been standing near enough to let him feel a conversation between him and mr binyley who came from the dogs for a few minutes to press his phone to join it hed asked me to say to me i must have been a dog id never let his phone go that way myself in this stupid manner you would not let that i certainly shall not you know how id attest it unless im particularly acquainted with no partner at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable your sisters have engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with i would not be so festive as you are i used to be willing for the kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and theres several of them you see uncomantly pretty you my dogs you only handsome girl in the room said mr darsit looking at the eldest and the spin it oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say there you be but do let me ask her one of the children what do you mean now chilling round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he would do all his own and colby said she is the one but not thats enough to do to me im in no humor at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slided by other men you would better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles you are wasting your time with me mr beane followed us advice mr darsit walked off and elizabeth of a main with no very cordial feeling towards him she told the story however with great spirit and influence for she had a life with playful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculous the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family mrs bennett had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party mr beane had darts with her twice and she had been distinguished by her sister jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quiet away elizabeth felt janes pleasure neve had heard us of mention to ms beane as the most accomplished girl in the neighborhood and as there an entity had been fortunate enough never to be without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for as a board they have turned their thought in good spirits to learn and learn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants they found him as the bennett still up with a book he was the guardless of time and on the presentation he had a good deal of curiosity out of the events of the evening which had faced such a sad and bad emotions he had rather than this voice used on the strange he would be disappointed but he soon found out that he had a different storm to eat oh my dear mr bennett as she entered the room we have had the most delightful moments actually though i wish you would be there jane was so admired and nothing could be like it everybody said how well she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice only thing of that to my dear he actually danced with him twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked the second time first of all he asked mr bingley because i was so thick to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know he had his little foot with jane as she was going around so he replied and she was and he danced with her and the twothirds he danced with was clear and the twofourth with mum and her because of the little frithy jane the twosix were the little and the blueroader if he had any compassion from me he tried to have been impatiently he would not have died half so much for gods sake say no more of his partner oh did he explain his heart in his first place oh my dear im quite delighted with him he is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses i dare say the lace upon mrs hursts gown here she was interrupted again mr benit protested against any description of fineoeary she was therefore obliged to seek another plunge on subject and the lady much busy with her and some exaggeration would be shortly removed but i can assure you she added that lizzie does not lose much by not shooting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable hollard man not at all worth pleasing so high and so conceited but there was no enduring him he worked here he worked there fancy and so so delicate not handsome enough to dance with i wish he would be in my day to have given him one of your setdowns i quite did test your mind shes the end this is where you would live off this morning all librevox recordings are in the public domain for more information art of volunteer please visit librevoxorg today is reading by kara shalinberg wwwkrayorg pride and prejudice by jane austen chapters 4 and 5 chapter 4 when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good humored lively and i never saw such happy manners so much ease with such perfect good breeding he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can i would very much flatter him by the asking me to dance a second time i did not expect such a compliment did not you i did for you but that is one great difference between us compliments always take you by surprise and me never what could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the world no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a stupider person oh you are a good deal to apt you know to like people in general you never see a fault in anybody all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life i would not wish to be hasty and censuring anyone but i always speak what i think i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candor is common enough one meets with it everywhere but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of everybodys character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone and so you like this mans sister too do you their manners are not equal to his certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbor in her elyseveth listened in silence but was not convinced their behavior at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humor when they were pleased nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it but proud and conceded they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of £20000 were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others they were other respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more intensely impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly 100000 pounds from his father he had intended to purchase any state but did not live to do it mr bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of money but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manner it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase his sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now any established as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs hearst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less than suppose to consider his house as her home when it suited her mr bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of great opposition of character bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness and the cruelty of his temper though no discrepancy could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied on the strength of darcys regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion in understanding darcy was the superior bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever he was at the same time haughty reserved and festidious and his manners though wellbred were not inviting in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving a fence the manner in which they spoke of the maritana assembly was sufficiently characteristic bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life everybody had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality she had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss benett he could not conceive an angel more beautiful darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure miss benett here acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much mrs hearst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and like her and friends turned to be a sweet girl and why didnt they would not object to know more of miss benett was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose end of chapter 4 chapter 5 within a short walk of longborn lived a family with whom the benets were particularly intimate sir william lucas had been formerly in trade on arisen where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honor of nighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residents in a small market town and in quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from mariton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercellious on the contrary he was all attention to everybody by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st jamess had made a courteous lady lucas was a little bit more but the little bit louder than the little bit louder than the little bit they had several children the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about 27 was elizabeths intimate friend that the mislead of food and the mislead of food is probably more wrong than whats in it and the morning after the assembly brought the former to montmore to hear it you began the evening well charlotte said mrs bennett with civil selfcommand to miss lucas you were mr bingleys first choice yes but he seemed to like his second better oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr robinson perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you mr robinsons asking him how he liked our merits and assemblies and whether he did not think there were great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennett beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point upon my word well that is very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he poor eliza to be only just tolerable i beg you would not put it into lizzies head to be vexed by his ill treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he set close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips are you quite sure maam is not there a little mistake said jane i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her i because she asked him at last how he liked another field and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to her ms bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintances with them he is remarkably agreeable i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hackshaze i do not mind his not talking to mrs long said ms lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza another time lizzie said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you i believe maam i may safely promise you never to dance with him his pride and his lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does he goes good excuse me one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune everything in his family if i mean so its fine he has a right to be proud that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine pride observed mary who picked herself upon the solidity of her reflections its a very common failing i believe i all but i have ever read i am confused that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things so the words are often used synonymously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us if i were as rich as mr darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep the clock of the clock sound and drink a bottle of wine today then you would drink a great deal more than you ought sid misses bennett and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended early with the visit and of chapter 5 recorded on november 6 2005 in oceanside california this is a librevox recording all librevox recordings are in the public domain for more information or to volunteer visit librevoxorg pride in prejudice by jane austen chapter 6 the ladies of long boys soon waited on his head at the end the visit was returned in due form miss bennetts pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of mrs hurst in this bingy and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the young sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw supercelliousness in their treatment of everybody hardly accepting even her sister he could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was how to value it was arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to hurt it with equally evident the jane was eeuwringed to preference which should be done to entertain for him from the perks and was in a way to be very much around but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guide her to the sisters of the impertinent you mentioned this to your friend this rucous it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman can see also a infection the same still can be perfect of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that its not safe to leave any to itself or we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are few of us who hurt enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better show more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister and doubtfully but he may never give her a reason like her she doesnt help her but she does hope him out as much as her nature will allow if i can perceive her regard for him he must be as simple to indeed not to discover it too remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do what if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavor to conceal it he must be a whiff she must be a whiff she must be a whiff she must be a whiff but the bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties its impossible that every moment should be employed and confercing together jane should therefore make the most of every hot hour in which she can command hers attention when she is secure of him there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses your plan is a good one you can hide over to them were nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it but these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design as yet she cannot even be certain that the decay of her own regard nor of its reason of illness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four dances with him at mariton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since died with him in company four times this is not quite enough to make her understand his character not as you represent it had she merely died with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together and four evenings may do a great deal yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vent on better than commerce but with respect to any other leaving characteristic i do not amare but much is been unfolded well such as the irish janes success with all my heart and if she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying as character for a 12 month happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar before hand it does not advance the felicity in the least they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of the exasciation and its better to know as little as possible for the effects of the person who needs to pass your life if you laughed charlotte but its not sound you know its not sound and you would never act this way yourself on the part of an observing mr dingleys attention to the sister elizabeth was bought from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend mr darcy had it first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when next they met he looked at her only to criticize but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and to his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face then he began to find it was rendered uncomantly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes to this discovery succeeded some others equal in more defying but he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure with perfect symmetry on the form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be like and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by the easy playfulness of course she was perfectly on the way to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with herself attended to her conversation with others hes doing so drew her notice it wasnt surreal you look at her it was a large party where assembled what does mr darcy mean she said to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel horster thats a question which mr darcy only can answer but if he doesnt anymore i shall certainly let him know that i see what hes about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinit myself i shall soon grow a fray to call on his approach and then see what hes like so without seeming to have any intention of speaking ms lucas defined her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did you not think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncomantly well just now when i was teasing colonel horster to give us a ball at marathon with great energy but its always a subject which makes a lady energetic you are severe on us it will be her turn soon to be teased so this lucas i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows you are a strange creature by way the friend always might need to play and sing for anybody my vanity had taken a musical turn you would be invaluable but as it is id really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers on this lucass persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must be and gravely glancing at mr darcy theres a final saying that everybody here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine just well my song her performance was pleasing though by no means capital after a song that she wanted to focus on she would be thanking she used to several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having inconsequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments and was always impatient for display mary had neither genius nor taste and the vanity had given her application it had given her likewise but pedantic error and conceded manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure theyre not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish heirs the request of her younger sisters and all the time of the liquor season two or three officers joined eagerly and dancing at one end of the room mr darcy stood here then in silent and bigdation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was much too engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbor until sir william must begin what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy theres nothing like dancing after all i consider it as one of the first refinements of polish society certainly so and it has the advantage also of being in folk amongst the best polish societies of the world every savage condense sir william on this mile we were friendly to the performance delightfully he continued after his husband unseen being the join the group and i doubt not that you were an adept in the science yourself mr darcy you saw me dance at marit and i believe sir yes indeed and receive no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do you often dance at st jamess you never sir do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i could avoid it you have a house in town i conclude mr darcy bowed i had once some thought of fixing and telling myself more and fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of one day would agree with lady lucas he ponds his hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant would be towards them he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing called out to her my dear mr liza why are you not dancing mr darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you cannot refuse to dance im sure when so much beauty is before you and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy whom she would have experienced a prize it was not a villain to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposier to sir william in dizor i have not the least intention of dancing i intrigued you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honor of her hand but in vain elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion you excel so much in the dance mr liza but its cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection im sure to have lied just for one half hour mr darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear liza can we not wonder at his complacence for who would object to such a partner elizabeth looked archely and turned away her resistance had not entered her with a gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when nosa costed by ms bingley i can guess the subject of your referee i should have nodded not you all are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society and indeed i the way of your opinion i was never more annoyed the insupportable it would be to realize the nothingness and yet the selfimportance all these people i would do it to be a special one you are congratulate instead of the longmission my mind would more greatly gain id been meditating on the very great pleasure which at para fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman mr mr bisto ms bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections mr darsary applied with great intripetity mr elizabeth bennett ms elizabeth bennett repeated ms bingley i am all astonishment how long has she been such a favorite im prayer when a much will wish you joy but this exactly the question which i expect you to ask a ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to match her money and a moment i knew you would be wishing me joy hmm if youre serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled youll be having a charming motherinlaw and date and of course she will always be a pepemberly with you he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his confuser he goes to her without a suit with a good playpony

librivoxorg pardon cuddles by jane austin chapter 7 mr bennetts property consisted almost entirely on an estate of 2000 a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of airs mail on a distant relation and their mothers fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of haze her father had been an attorney and married him and had left her 4000 parlans she had a sister married to an ester phillips whod been equipped to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade the village of longborn was only one mile from the mountain and most convenient distance for the young ladies who were easily tempted to their three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt until a milliner shop just over the way the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meriton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however there of news the country in general might be they always can try to learn something from their aunt at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighborhood it was to remain the whole winter and meriton was the headquarters their visits to mrs phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves mr phillips visited the mall and this opened to his nieces a store of publicity unknown before they could talk of nothing but officers and mr bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regiments of an innocent after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr bennett williams from all that i can collect by your manner of talking and i must be too abistilious girls in the country ive suspected it some time but i am now convinced catherine was just concerted and made no answer but maybe i would prefer the condifference continue to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london im astonished my dear so mrs bennett that you should be so ready to think your own childrens silly if i wished to think slightly of anybodys children should not be of my own however if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it yes but as it happens theyre all of the very clever this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree id hope that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish my dear mr bennett you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers anymore than we do i remember the time when i liked to redcoat myself very well and in three months they did it my heart and if a smart girl would kind of require this if theres no one to welcome them my girls my shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very at becoming the other night at sir wilhelm you can hear the red and thats it mom and her for you my answer is the colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to this watson so they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarks library mrs bennett was prevented from replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for ms bennett it came from another field and the servant waited for an answer mrs bennetts eyes sparkle with pleasure which he was eagerly calling out on her daughter will jane whos a father whats in the mouth what can she say will jane make hasten tell us make hasten love it is from ms bingley sir jane and then redored aloud my dear friend if you are not so compassionate as to dying today with the weaset and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole day is tetatet between two women to never end without a quarrel come as soon as you can when we see to this my brother and the gentleman are to die with me officers i was never in a caroline thing with the officers cried lydia i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that dining out said this has been it that is very unlucky can i have a carriage ask jane no my dear you did not go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home oh with the gentleman we will have mr bingleys chairs to go to the marathon and the first submenor horses to theirs id much rather go to the coach but my dear your father cannot spare the horses im sure they wanted in the farm mr gunnick or they not they wanted in the farm much healthier than i can get them but if youve got them today said elizabeth my mothers purpose will be answered she did it last extort from her father and acknowledgement that the horses were engaged jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the doofthedwarth many cheerful prognostics of a bad day her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted the rain continued the whole evening without a commission jane certainly not come back this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs bennett more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own till the next morning however she was not aware of all the publicity of her contrivens breakfast was scarce leover when a servant from another field brought the following notes for elizabeth my dear lizzy i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will not hear of my returning to line better the insist also on my seeing mr jones therefore do not be alarmed if he should hear of his having been to me and accepting a source throw and headache there is not much the matter with me yours et cetera well my dear said mr bennett when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous bit of illness she should cry it would be a comfort to note in the call of the suit of mr bingley and under your orders oh im not afraid of her dying people do not die of little trifling colds shell be taken good care of as long as she stays there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the carriage elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no worse woman walking was her only alternative she declared her resolution how can you be so silly my dear mother i still think of such a thing well theres dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get there i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i know is this a good to me lizzie so her father just seemed for the horkeys no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner i admire the activity of your benevolence observe mary but every impulsive feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required we will go as far as marriage and with you suncather and in lydia elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together its a nice waste its a brilliant idea that they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes in marathon they parted the two young guests repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued to walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over styles and springing other puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last with the view of the house with weary angles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise she was shown into the breakfast bar for all but jane was assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise that she should have walked three miles so early in the day and such dirty weather in thought herself was almost incredible to mrs herst and ms bingley and elizabeth was convinced that theyre hovering in contempt for it she was received however dedicated to lightly by them and in the brothers manners there was something better than for lightness there was good humor and kindness mr darcy said very little and mr herst nothing at all the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancey which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone the lie was thinking only of his breakfast her inquiry is after her sister were not very favorably answered ms bennet had slept ill and though up was feverish and not well enough to leave her room elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane and only had been the call by the fear of giving a loar and convenience from expressing her no but how much she longed for such a visit was delighted with her entrance she was not equal in however too much conversation and when ms bingley left them together could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with elizabeth silently attended her when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they should for jane the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be the host which she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavor to get the better of it it advised her to return to bed and promised her some drops the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her headache to cutely elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and vary unwillingly said so ms bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in partying with her that ms bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chains to an invitation to an aid that had never failed for the present elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longborn to equate the family with her stay

elizabeth was summoned to dinner to the civil inquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingleys she could not make a very favorable answer jane will find no means better the six girls had her eyes she could feel her eyes on the street she was so happy to have a baby and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of them and their indifference towards jane and that would be really good for them the story of the two ladies running all the time in the city their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered a challenge she had very little notice from any but him miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and thats for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only the eat drink and play at cards who when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragu had nothing to say to her when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out she was so proud to be very bad indeed mr hurst tried an impurtonance she had no conversation no style no beauty mrs hurst thought the same and added she has nothing in short to recommend her but bingley and exmund walker i shall never forget her appearance this morning she really looked almost wild she did indeed louise i could hardly keep my countenance very nonsensical to come at all why was she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowy yes and her petty coat i hope you saw her petty coat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain the gown should have been let down to hide it not doing its office your picture very exact louise but this was all lost upon me i felt miss liz bethelik and she looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petty coat quite escaped my notice you observed it mr dysie i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition so it may not to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it was a buffer ankles in dirt and a loan quite alone what could she mean by it it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceiving the pun almost country town indifference to decorum it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley youve prayed mr dysie youve served miss bingley in half the this adventure has rather affected your admiration for fine hours hello for the friend of the lander size i sure paused followed this speech and mrs hearst began again i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennett she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all of my hearts she were well set but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on marathon yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheap side that is capital added her sister and they both laughed hardily if they had uncles enough to fill all cheap side cried bingley it would not make them one job less agreeable the rest of the church is very pleasant the nation in the world replied darcy to this speech bingley made them into but his sisters gave it their heart a scent and engulfed their birth for some time at the expense of their dear friends while the relations with a renewal of tenderness however they returned to her room on leaving the dining parlor and sat with her till summoned to coffee she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had become pretty seen her sleep and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at little and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would use her sock for the short time she could stay below with a book mr hurst looked at her with astonishment do you prefer reading to congress said he that is rather singular miss eliza behmann said miss bingley despises cars she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else i deserve neither such crazy more such censure cry to elizabeth i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things in nursing your sister im sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will be soon be increased by seeing her quite well elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked toward the table where a few books were lying he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own friends that i am an idol fellow and though i have not known her i have more than i ever looked into elizabeth assured him that she could see herself perfectly with those in the room i am astonished said miss bingley but my father should have left so small a collection of books what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr darcy it ought to be good and youre blind it has been the work of many generations and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley i wish it may but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighborhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a finer county in england than darbyshire with all my heart i would buy pemberley yourself its just a piece of stuff im always talking of possibilities charles upon my word carolyn i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation elizabeth was so much caught with what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying at holy siren tell the sister who deserve the game this is the star soon much grown since the spring said miss bingly will she be as tall as i am i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennetts life rather taller how long do you see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me so much such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age performance on the piano force is exquisite it is amazing to me said bingly how young ladies can have the patience to be so very accomplished as they are all young ladies are accomplished i fear charles what do you mean yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover screens and net purses i scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this and im sure i never heard a young lady spoken up for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy as too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no other woman and by many she will come from the tree but i am very far from agreeing with you and your estimation of ladies in general i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished no i am sure she is missing me then observe the elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal and your idea of a accomplished woman yes i do comprehend a great deal in it oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed to god but is not a great piece of past what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and modern languages to deserve the word in the side of her she must possess the certain suffering in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions all of the word for people has to deserve all this she must possess and to others she must get out of something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading i know how to surprise that you are knowing only six accomplished women i rather wonder now what you are knowing any are you so sincere upon your own sex as the death of possibility of all this i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you described united mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her and cried doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward as all conversations were by add and end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room or elizabeth bennett said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds but in my opinion it is a poultry device a very mean art undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was deeply addressed there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes come to send to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as she continued the subject elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her bingley urged mr jones being sent for immediately while his sister convinced that no country advice could be of any privilege recommended in the expressed account for her in the list of men in the position this she was not here up but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers as proposal and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early morning if miss benet were not decided wed better bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miss benet they saw a star that she can tell that she might be that doctors office while he could not even know about her belief to his feelings then by giving his housekeeper a collection that every attention might be paid to the sixth lady and her sister and of chapter 8 recorded by morino brian kettering

electricsblogsbotcom pride and prejudice by jane austen chapter 9 elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable instrument to the chamber to the very early visit and is to be able to buy an old book and sometimes you heard from the few arrogant lady who laid one in the sky and started the film she requested to have a note to her own book desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with mrs benet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast but she kept jane and many people in danger this is better when the very miserable but seeing satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably be more likely to be more likely to be she would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal to come out of the restaurant she would be a prophet to her to rise about the same time think it at all advisable after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast horror bingering met them in post that mrs benet had not found miss benet worse than she expected indeed i have sir was her answer she is a great deal to ill to be moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must pass a little longer on your kindness the moved cried bingley it must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal she made a pen to call it madden so at miss bingley it is called to the room then at this minute well receive every possible attention while she remains with us mrs benet was profused in her acknowledgements i am sure she is it was the first such girl friends i did not know where she is very ill in deed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest case always the way with her the sweetest temper i have ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her you know that sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over the gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is equal to never feel you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease whatever i do is down in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit never feel i should probably ask him five minutes that present however i consider myself as quite fixed to you that is exactly what i should have said to you do you think you can do it right he turning toward her oh yes i understand you perfectly i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful that is as it happens it does not follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffering to do with her i dont know the fact that you are the only immediately that you were a study or a character it must be an amusing study yes look its a character its a very interesting character they have at least that advantage the country said darcy can in general supply that a piece of the set of studies and you cant believe this is a very very fine and you can do it in a fight people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them forever yes indeed cried mrs bennett offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighborhood i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town for a moment turn silently away mrs bennett who fancy she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal pleasant i must be in a country here at the end of the country i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each third advantages and i can be equally happy in either ah that is because you have a right disposition the that gentleman the working at darcy seemed to think the career was nothing at all and he and my mother who are mistaken said elizabeth blessing for her mother you quite missed up mr darcy he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town which you must acknowledge to be true certainly my dear nobody said there were that as to not meeting with many people in this neighborhood i believe there are a few neighborhoods more than i can or in 20 families nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable them way to keep his countenance his sister was less delicate and directed her eyes toward mr darcy with a very expressive smile elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now ask her to say what elizabeth and my mother said are coming away yes she called yesterday with her father what an agreeable man is it a man of passion so gentle and easy he had always something to say to everybody that is my idea of the grief and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter did charlotte die with you no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies for my part mr bingley i always keep so much thinking to their own mother my daughters have brought them down the deputy is to judge for themselves and the locuses are very good sort of girls it is a pity they are not in some not that i think charlottes so very plain but men she is our particular friend she seems a very pleasant young woman oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself is our own son and me and johns mother i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure our jane one does not often see anybody better looking it is what everybody says i do not trust my own partiality when she was only 15 there was a man at my brothers garden brother gardeners and animals so much in love with her but my sister and law was sure he would make her an offscreen i do not know if she knows perhaps he thought it too young however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were and so ended his affection settle is a bit impatiently there has been many a one i fancy overcom in the same way i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry and driving way low why have been used to consider poetry as the food of love settarcy the fine stout healthy love it may everything nerd it might be like thin sort of information i am convinced that one wood son is started entirely away darcy only saw it in the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble less term other should be exposing herself again she long to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs bennett began repeating her thanks to mr pinkley for his kindness to jane and the poetry to present him also a good mr pinkley will all praise the lord and she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs bennett was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her care upon this evening the youngest of her daughters put her son for her the youngest of her daughters put her son for her the two girls who can move from each other hearing the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest of the tax mr pinkley with having friends is first coming to the country to give a fall in the country the whole is a stout well grown girl 15 with a fine complexion and look at an early age she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which the attention of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance she was very equal therefore to address mr pinkley on the subject of the fall and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it his name was said in the tax was delightful to their mothers ear i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the fall but you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill lydia declared herself satisfied oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely kept in the heart or without merit in again and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on there to be more awesome i shall tell her more forst to it will be quite a shame if he does not mrs bennett and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her

had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to men in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room the lutebel however did not appear mr darcy was writing and miss vingley stood here as much of the office of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister mr hearst and miss vingley were out to pay attention and mrs hearst was observing their game elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently used in attending the past between verse and his companion the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in union with her opinion of each how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter he made no answer you write uncomantly fast you are mistaken i write rather slowly how many letters you must have occasion to write at the course of a year that is missed too how old is i should think them it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of yours pray tell your sister that i long to see her i have already told her so much that im here i am afraid you do not like your pen let me mend it for you i mend pens remarkably well thank you but i always mend my own sign up tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the heart and very very very very very very important in the actions of her you do for the little design for a table i think it infinitely superior to miss grant lays will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again at present i have not room to do them justice your in january but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy they are generally long whether i will watch harming i love me i am very very very very important in the words of my right of all that i read i cannot write that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline because he does not write the means he studies too much for words of force and the voice of her my style of writing is very different from yours oh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letter is sometimes conveying no ideas at all to my correspondents your human is a deepest victim must decide to prove nothing is more deceitful to death than the parents of your middle hes often on a carelessness and in sometimes an indirect post and which do you two call my little recent piece of mottestine the indirect post are you a really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think it makes quite interesting the power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor and without any attention to the imperfection of the performance when you talk this is minute of this morning the diff you ever resolved upon quitting another field you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of pen and gyric of compliment yourself and yet what is there is a very portable minute precipitants which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things were said in the morning and yet upon my honor i believe what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitants my dear say but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such a celebrity what does that mean the chance is not being made of mine and youve had to be with your brother so i think thats what im saying well be doing it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month you have only approved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did not do this but its just an answer to the situation he said he said he said he said i am extremely gratified im so sorry but i am afraid that you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and write off as fast as i could wood mr darcy then consider the rationales of your original intentions as a tone for by your obstinancy in adhering to it upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember ms bennett that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favor of its propriety to yield readily easily to the persuasion of the friend who is no merit with you to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the request or would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps to the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behavior thereupon but in general an ordinary case is between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great point i think youll that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to opportunity this request as well as the degree of interest in subsistence but all means right bingley let us hear all the particulars of any pair of height and size for that will have more weight in the argument ms bennett then you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy or not such a great tall fellow in the persons myself i should not pay him half so much difference i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places as his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh ms bennett in the deep detail of her seat in an ex postulation with her brother for talking to such a little sense i see your design bingley set his friend you dislike an argument and want to silence this perhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you in this bennett will defer your wars delimount of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like if you like please like share and subscribe mr darcy i want you to have a better question mr darcy to have a nice and detailed answer when that business was over he applied to ms bingley and elizabeth for me they please have some nice answers ms bingley we have the son of a lot shes a lot of property to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other is politely and more earnestly negative she sees it herself mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were missing she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcys eyes were fixed on her she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great men and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was something wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present the supposition did not pain her she liked him too little to care for his approvation after playing some italian songs ms bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch here and soon afterwards mr darcy dr nier elizabeth said to her to not feel a great inclination to spend it to see such an opportunity of dancing a real she smiled he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence oh she said i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say and reply you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated intent i have to be a better person than you than you to dance a real at all and now despise me if you dare indeed i do not dare elizabeth having rather expected to a front him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archnous in her manner which made it difficult for her to a front anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her he really believed that were not for the inferiority of her connections he should be ashamed of this mr nier elizabeth saw four suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her and her friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her ghost by talking up the air supposed to be a witch i think its in such an alliance i hope she said as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your motherinlaw a few weeks when they seem to disappear its a place in this world and if you can come visit do sure the younger girls of running after officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject in devere to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity oh yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt phillips be placed in the gallery at pemberley but the next to your great uncle the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different lines as for your elizabeths picture you must not have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape your eyelashes so remarkable at that moment they were in that corner of the walk by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley and some confusion less they had been overheard you used us a bomb and a bleed ill answered mrs hurst running away without telling us that you were coming out then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself the path just admitted three mr darcy felt their roots in the beginning of the same this walking among white and strong party in the middle of the avenue but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are you are charmingly bruised the picture asks would be spoiled by admitting a fourth goodbye she then ran gale off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in the day or two jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours at evening and of chapter 10 this is a librevox recording all librevox recordings are in the public domain for more information on how to volunteer please visit wwwlibervoxorg thats librivivoxorg this reading by gordon kinsey pride and prejudice by jane austen chapter 10 the day passed much as the day before had done mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room the lootable however did not appear mr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister mr hurst and mr bingley were at peket and mrs hurst was observing their game elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in union with her opinion of each how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter lady bait i cant believe that you are mistaken i write rather slowly how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year that is business too how bold is such a victim it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of yours pray tell your sister that i long to see her i have already told her so once my own desire i am afraid you do not like your pen let me mend it for you i mend pens remarkably well thank you you can try it to write so even he was silent tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and then the infinite place of purier to me you give me leave to defer raptures to our right again at present i have not needed to give them justice though it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cry to her brother because he does not write with ease he studies too much for words of force syllables do not you darcy my style of writing is very different from yours oh cried miss pinkley charles writes in the most careless way imagine he leaves out half his words and glots the rest my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which your humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproved nothing is more deceitful said darcy then the appearance of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion in sometimes an indirect boast and which do you to call my little recent piece of modesty the indirect boast or you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from remedy of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting the power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the pleasure and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs bennett this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting another field you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panagiric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there is a very lotable in a precipitence which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or at all and you are at the edge to yourself or anyone else nay prizedly this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things were said in the morning and yet upon my honor i believe what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of meatless precipitence merely to show off before the ladies but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such a celebrity youll conduct what youd be quite as dependent on chance as any man i know and if as for i would force a friend who say bigly with the rest of the next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month you have only proved by this right elizabeth that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shown him off now much more than he did himself i am extremely gratified said bingley by your convertors help me help me help me help me but im afraid you are giving it a stir which you have to for he would certainly think that meat if under such a circumstance i would give a flat denial and hide off as fast as i could wood mr darcy then consider the rational severe conventional intentions as a tone for by your obstinance on my word i cannot exactly explain that or rather dont understand self you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember ms benley that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favor of its propriety to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either you appear to me mr darcy to allow me to think that the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the request or would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly as big as such a case as you are supposed to by mr benley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behavior for a pawn but in general the request is between friends and friends we are one of the most desire by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be… will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to entertain his request as well as the degree of emphasis and system to entertain the parties but all means… right bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have a more weight in the argument as a minute than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much difference i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and opposite to him when he has nothing to do mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expossulation with her brother for talking such nonsense i see your design bingley set his friend you dislike an argument and want to silence this perhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and miss bennett will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me what you ask sit a little bit is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finishes letter mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for an indulgence of some music miss bingley moved with some alakrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other is politely and more earnestly negative she seated herself mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcys eyes were fixed on her she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was something wrong and regretful according to his name right and in the other persons present the supposition did not paint she liked him too little to care for his approbation after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch heir and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her to not to feel a great inclination miss bingley to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel she smiled but made no answer he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence oh she said i heard you before but i could not immediately turn myself in i wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare indeed i do not dare elizabeth having rather expected to a front him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archnous in her manner which made it difficult for her to a front anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her he really believed that were not such a fool the next one is he should be in some danger miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire to get rid of elizabeth she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance i hope she said as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue do you will you run after officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject in defer to check that little something bordering on conceit and imperponents which you are late in possesses have you anything else to propose for my victim oh yes do let the portraits of your uncle and and phillips be placed in the gap and apparently put them next to your hand on the church they are in the same profession you know only in different laws as for your elizabeths picture you must not have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes it would not be easy to catch their specials but their color and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be copied at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion less they had been overheard you used us a bomb in a blue earl and said mrs hurst run away without telling us that you were found then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself the path just admitted three mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the armband but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are you are charmingly grouped and appear to uncommon advantage the pictureesque would be spoiled by admitting a fourth goodbye she then ran gale off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in the day or two jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening end of chapter 10 chapter 11 when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her wellgowned attendant her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentleman appeared there are powers of conversation were considerable they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humor and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit but when the gentleman entered jane was no longer the first object miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps he addressed himself to miss bennett with a polite congratulation mr hurst also liked her and said he was very glad but diffuses in war he was full of joy and attention the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire less she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace that she might be further from the door he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to anyone else elizabeth had worked in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight when the tea was over mr hurst reminded his sister a law of the car table but in vain she had a private intelligence that mr darcy had taken on wish for the cards and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed too justified mr hurst had therefore nothing to do but distret himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs hurst picked him up and applied and planned with her wish to attend this joint now and then in her brothers conversation with miss bennett miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcys progress as his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page she could not in the appellator to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yon and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires the police have to never put and i have a house in my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library no one made any reply she then yoned again through a side her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement the hearing of other mentionedly called calls to his men she turned suddenly towards him and said by the by charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at another field i would advise you before you determine only to get some permission from the present party i am much more staking if there are not some among us we will all be rather a punishment than a pleasure if you mean darcy writer brother he may go to bed if he chooses before he begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nichols has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards i should like balls infinitely better sheer plot if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferable of tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing we made the order of the day much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball it misbeculably made no answer and soon afterwards she got up and walked about to her her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious in the desperation of her feelings she was all done onenaffered more and turning to elizabeth said mr lysubinit let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked up he was as much awake to the novelty of attention and her character as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down together with either of which motives hes joining them it would interfere what could he mean she was joining them but could he be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand not at all it was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him to ask if they could marry her miss bingley however was being capable of disengointed mr darcy in anything and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak you either chose this method of passing the evening because you are in the peak of its confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i would be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i say by the fire oh shocking right miss bingley i never heard anything so abominable i know you have such a speech nothing so easy if you have but the inclination sittalism we can all play and punish one another tease him laugh at him interveness worry must know how it is to be done but upon my honor i do not i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught that tease calmness of manner and presence of mind no no feel he may defy us there he tends to laugh with a dare mr darcy may hunt himself mr darcy is not to be laughed at that is an uncommon advantage an uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances i dearly love a laugh miss bingley said he has given me more credit than can be the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions maybe rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke certainly the flight is here there are arms but i hope i hope i never reach a point of thought but fallies and nonsense wims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are a sightseeing you are with that perhaps that is not possible for anyone because in the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule such as vanity and pride yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation elizabeth turned away to hide a smile your examination of mr darcy is over i presume said miss bingley im afraid that it was this what it was this im afraid that it was this he owns it himself for their disguise no said darcy i have made no such pretentious i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding i temper i dare not vote for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little they convenience of the world i cannot forget the following some faces of others so soon as i am no there are fences against myself my feelings are not ive devout with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called it is awful my good opinion once lost is lost forever he is a failing indeed cridalism is a shame i am a terrible resentment it is a shame i am a terrible resentment i cannot laugh at it i am a cruel man there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome and your defect is too hate everybody and yours he replied with a smile is willfully to misunderstand them do let us have a little music cridmiss being retired of a conversation in which she had no share louisa you will not mind my waking mr hurst her sister had not the smoke her sister had not the smoke after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it you began to feel the danger of the evil as it has to be too much attention end of chapter 11 this is a librivox recording all librivox recordings are in the problem of demand for more information please visit librivoxorg todays reading is pride and prejudice by jane huston the chapters 12 and 13 chapter 12 in quotes weve been with between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day but mrs spenett who had calculated on her daughters remaining at never due to the following tuesday which would exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before her answer therefore was not a propitious at least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home mrs spenett sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postcript it was added that a mr bingley and a sister press them to stay longer she could spare them for a while against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved all she was expected would be asked and fearful on the contrary has been considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr bingleys carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving never filled that morning should be mentioned the creation was slightly different any professions have concerned and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work in jane until the morrow their going was deferred ms bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister might exceed it her affection for the other the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they would have owed so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade ms bennett that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered the jane was firm where she felt herself to be right to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at another field long enough she attracted him more than he liked and ms bingley was uncivil to her and bought teasing the usual to himself he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity since the fact that if such an idea had been suggested his behavior during the last day must have material waiting confirming or crushing it steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for an hour he had heard most conscientiously do his book and would not even look at her on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place ms bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as the reflection of the jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the playshade would always give her to see her either at longboard or at neppocrates and embracing the most tender she even shook hands with the firm elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the lively spirits they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother mrs bingley wondered her that coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again but their father though very iconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough base and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of thread bear morality to listen to catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort much had been done and much had been said to the regiments since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had died lately with their uncle a private had been flamed and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married chapter 13 i hope my dear said mr bennett to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a food dinner today because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party who do you mean my dear i dont know if nobody that is coming im sure unless the charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinner is a good enough for her and do not believe she often sees such at home the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger mrs bennetts eyes are sparkled the gentleman and a stranger it is mr bingley im sure why jane you never dropped a word of this you slight thing well im sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley but good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got today lydia my love ring the bell i must speak to her this moment it is not mr bingley ill set her husband he is a person who i never saw before in the course of my life this rast a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once after a reason himself sometime with their curiosity he thus explained about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he places oh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mention pray do not talk of that odious man i do think its the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children im sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or rather about it jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs bennett was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling in a state away from a family of five daughters in favor of a man who nobody cared anything about it certainly is a most iniquid as a fair said mr bennett and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longborn but you few will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself no that im sure i shall not and i think it was very impurted and off him to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such false friends why could not he keep on quarreling with you as his father did before him why indeed he does seem to have some filial scruble in that head as you will hear huntsford near west ham kent 15th october deer sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much unisness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing less did might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance tham is his bet at my mind however is now made up on a subject for having received ordination at east ham i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honorable lady catherine de berg widow of sir louis de berg who is bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean the sight of late respect towards her face and be ever ready to perform those rights and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england as a clergyman moreover i feel it more duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of minefulence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of goodwill are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next to me in tale of longworn state will be kindly overloading your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch i cannot be otherwise concerned at being the means of injuring your amyreal daughters and make me do the college of my own as well as i am sure you of my readiness to make them every possible immense but of this hereafter if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family one laying november 18th or november 14th and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday so night following which i can do without any convenience a slated catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on sunday providing that some other clergymen is engaged to do the duty of the day i remain disobeyed with respect to the confidence to your lady and daughters your wellwisher and friend william collins at 4 oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking gentleman said mr bennett as he folded up the letter he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any men i shall not be the person to discourage him though it is difficult sanjay to guess in what way he can mean to make us the eternity things are due the wish certainly to his credit elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary difference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required he must be an oddity i think sanjay i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style what can he mean by apologising for being next to me and tell we cannot supposedly would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of civility and selfimportance in his letter to promise as well i am impatient to see him in point of composition san mary this letter does not seem effective the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed to catherine and lydia and neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting it was next to me plus it that their consums should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they have received pressure from the society of a man in any other colour as for their mother mr collins letter had done away with much of her ill will and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which has polished her as a bottle mr collins was a punctual twist by him and was received great polygons by the whole family mr bennett indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself he was a tall heavylooking young man of 5 and 20 his air was graven stately and his manners were very formal he had not been seated long before he complimented mrs bennett on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his heroes but mrs bennett who quarrel with no compliments answered most readily very kind im sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so oddly you a lute perhaps to the end tale of this estate as sir i do indeed its a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how a state will go and once they come to be entailed i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate but i can assure you the young ladies that i cant prepare to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other they were not the only objects of mr collins admiration the hall the dining room and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs bennetts heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing at all as his own future property the dinner too which term was highly admired and he picked to know to which of his fair cousins instance of its cooking was only but here who was set right by mrs bennett was short of its prosperity that they were very well able to be a goodforfor and that her daughter said nothing to do with future he begged pardon for having displaced her in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for the amount of cultural for now that is the end of chapter 13 this is liverpools recording liverpools recordings are in

elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg the other carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day but mrs bennett who had calculated on her daughters remaining at the end of the day to the following tuesday which were exactly finished chains we had could not bring herself to a single with a pleasure before her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home mrs bennett sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postcript it was added that a mr bingly and a sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well against staying longer elizabeth was positively resolved nor would it be the contrary has been considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr binglys carriage immediately at length it was settled but the original design of leaving never filled that morning should be mentioned and the request made the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was sent which she would to stay until the following day to work on jane and till the morrow theyd go in was deferred ms bingly was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister might exceed it her affection for the other the monster fell out and led with a real sorrow that they would go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade ms bennett that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough she attracted him more than he liked and ms bingly was in similar to her and more teasing than usual to him so while he was in result to be particularly careful no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that elevate her with the hope of influencing his fall asleep sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behavior during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he had hid most of her changes for days before on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place ms binglys civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longborn or at never the field and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former elizabeth took leave of the whole party to fight with smithers they were not welcomed home very cordially by them but mrs bingly wondered if theyre coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and were sure jane would have caught cold again but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all it says by the absence of jane and elizabeth they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough base and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbombmourna to the city catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort much had been done and much had been said in the regimen since the preceding wednesday several of the officers have died lately with their children a private had been robbed and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married chapter 13 i hope my dear said mr bennett to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner today because i have reason to expect an addition to our family part who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming im sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call him and i hope my dinner is good enough for her and i do not believe she will not see such at home the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger mrs bennetts eyes are sparkled a gentleman and a stranger it is mr bingley im sure right jane never dropped a word of this you slight thing well im sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley but good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got today lydia my loving the bell i must speak to heal this moment it is not mr bingley said a husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life this rast a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once after amusing himself sometime with their curiosity he thus explained about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may tell you all out of this house as soon as he pleases oh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mention pray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thing in the world to a stage be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or rather a bunch of things jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs bennett was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling in a state away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man who made it clear anything about it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennett and nothing can clear mr president of the guild of enheriting longborn but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impotent of him to write to you at all and very my face is all strange why could not he keep on quarreling with you as his father did before him why indeed he just seemed to have some filial scruples in that head as you will hear huntsford you are wasted dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much unisonous and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing less it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be honoured for having received an international act list i had been so much honoured and hastily distinguished by the patronage of the right honorable lady catherine de berg widow of sir louis de berg whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my oldest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect for its her lady ship and be ever ready to perform those rights and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of goodwill are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longborn estate would obtain a bullet to your side and not lead you to eject the offered olive branch i cannot be otherwise concerned at being the means of injuring your evil daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible immense but of this year after if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november 18th by 4 oclock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday so night following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday providing that some other clergymen is engaged to do the duty of the day i remain discer with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your wellwisher and friend william collins at 4 oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking gentleman and said mr benad as he folded up the letter he seems to be a most conscientious polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any men as i shall not be the person to discourage him though it is difficult such a aim to guess in what way he can mean to make the entomedy things are due the wish is certainly to his credit elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary difference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it would be planned he was being ordered to have been essentially i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man no i dare i think not i think he really hopes to find a good way to reverse there is a mixture of civility and selfimportance in his letter which promises well i am a big host in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem defective the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour as for their mother mr collins letter had done away with much of her own bill actually was preparing to see him with a degree of composure into scholarships and an orders mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family mr bennett indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself he was a tall heavylooking young man of 5 and 20 his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal he had not been seated long before he complimented mrs bennett on having so fine and family of daughters he said he had heard much of their beauty but had in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his heroes but mrs bennett who quarrel with no problems and he answered most readily there we climbed on shore and i wished with all my heart it may prove so for else they would be destitute enough things are settled so oddly you are lud perhaps to the end tale of this estate master i do indeed its a grievous affair to my poor girls who must confess not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how a state will go in once they come to be entailed i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate but i can assure you the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps when we have it repainted he was interrupted by a summits to dinner the girls smiled on each other they were not the only objects of mr collins admiration the hall the dining room and all its furniture were examined and placed and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs bennetts heart but for them mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know the witch of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing but here he was set right by mrs bennett who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her doctors had nothing to do in the kitchen he begged pardon for having displeased her in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologize for the fact that the author of an hour that is the end of chapter 13 this is a librevox recording all librevox recordings are in the public domain for more information or to volunteer please visit librevoxorg this recording by mark bradford pride and prejudice by jane austen chapter 14 during dinner mr bennett scarce spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversations with his guests and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness lady catherine de wargs attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable mr bennett could not know she was never there mr collins was eloquent in her praise the subject elevated him to more than usual salinity of manner yet never in his life witnessed such behavior in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine she had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honor of preaching before her she had also asked him twice to die of the princess and had sent for him only the seven days before make up her pool of the queryll in the evening lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen anything but affability in her she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighborhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble personage or she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouched safe to suggest some herself some shelves in the closet upstairs that is all very proper in civil i am sure said mrs bennett and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her does she live near you sir the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a land from rosens park her lady should dress it as i think she said she was a widower has she any family she has only one daughter the eras of rosens and a very extensive property ah sidneys been it shaking her head then she is better off than many girls and what sort of young lady is she is she handsome she is the most charming lady in the evening and the pattern herself says that in point of true beauty mr ward is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintendent her education and who still resides with them but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little faton and ponies has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at court her indifference state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornaments for lady ship in peace is your ideal and you may imagine that i am happy that every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her these are the kind of little things which please her lady ship and it is a sort of attention which i can see myself peculiarly bound to pay you judge very properly sir mr bennett and you did happy for you that you possess the talent of catherine the delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attention is perceived from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study thank you we are at tcree for a lot of hearts in the palm and though i sometimes amuse myself for suggesting that i am a angel to clittle elegant compliments of lady catherine to the original occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied in there as possible mr bennetts expectations were fully answered his cousin was his absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure by ttime however the dose had been enough and mr bennett was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again and when t was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies mr collins readily ascended and a book was produced but on beholding it for everything an altitude to be from a circulating library he started back and begging part for test of that he never read novels giddy stared at him at lydia explained other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose four dices sermons lydia gaped as he opened to the volume and before he had with very monotonous salinity read three pages she had interrupted him with do you know mava that my uncle phillips talks of turning away richard and if he does for her firsterval higherhand my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to marietan tomorrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town lydia was bid by her two eldestassisted and she said well mr collins much offended they decide his book and said i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it amazes me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction but i will no longer import your life then turning to mr bennett he offered himself as his antagonist at that geman mr bennett accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling and usements mrs bennett entered otters apologized most civilly for lydias interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but mr collins after assuring them that he bore his own cousin dont weel which had never been sent her behaviors any of front he did himself at another table with mr bennett and prepared for backgammon chapter 15 mr collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it in a useful acquaintance the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the selfconceived belief head living the retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity a fortunate chance that an independent lady kept her poor when the living of her husband was vacant and respect for her child and her generation for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his right as a rector made him altogether a mixture of the pride of the people of his business selfimportance and humility having now a good house and a very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longborn family he had a wife in view as he meant to choose one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and imbibble as they were represented by common report this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their fathers estate and he thought it in excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own path his plan did not vary on seeing them miss bennetts lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settled choice the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hours tithatead with mrs bennett before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parcel of a childs and leading a produced from her a midvery complacent smiles in general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on as to her younger daughters she could not take it upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any preposition her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while mrs bennett was stirring the fire elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course mrs bennett treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before is now high in her good graces lydias intention of walking to marriage and he was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr collins was to attend them at the request of mr bennett who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for vither mr collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue namely engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr bennett with little cessation of his house and gardener touched doings discomposed mr bennett exceedingly his library could get the knowledge for a pleasure and a clue and over the pair as he told elizabeth to meet with fully and his every other room of the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters and the wealth and the wealth the in fact much better fitted for a walker in the reader was extremely pleased to close his large book and go in pompous nothings on his side and civil assence on that of his cousins their time passed till the entered marathon the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him their eyes were immediately wandering on the same night by the same night of the fathom a lovely place that i am very sure about a great place to be able to be a guide to the world of the world of the world but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemen like appearance walking with another officer on the other side of the way the officer was the very mr denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to a fire and he bowed and then they passed all the strength of the strangers here all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined the fathom that they find out let the way across the sea under pretence of wanting some bounding and opposite shop unfortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot mr denny addressed them directly and entrusted permission to introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned within the day before and he was happy to see had accepted the commission in their four this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming his appearance was greatly in his favor he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party was still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities bingley was the principal spokesman and was bennett the principal option he was then he said on his way to longward on purpose to admire after her mr darcy corroborated it with a bow it was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at him they changed color one looked white the other red mr wickham after a few moments touch his hat a salutation which mr darcy just didnt know anything what could be the meaning of it whos a husband the imagine it was impossible not to belong to no in another minute mr bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave the road on mr denny and his quicklearned walked with the young ladies to the door of mr phillips house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias pressing and treaties that she took in and even in spite of mrs phillipss current departure from palmerston and loudly seconding the invitation mrs phillips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise that their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not touched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr joness shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not descended anymore drafts to netherland because the miss benets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by james introduction of him they received the letter and buried thats falan he returned with as much more apologizing for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help but laugh at himself however might he justify for his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice mrs phillips was quite odd by such an excess of good reading but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by explanation that the three used to go together of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenants commission in the blank shy she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have been to the occupation but im lucky that one person in the house windows now would have to move the officers who in comparison with the stranger would become stupid disagreeable fellows some of them were to die with the phillipss the next day and there on promised to make her husband call on mr wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longborn would come in the evening this was agreed to and mrs phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of other idiots and a little bit of hot supper afterwards the prospect of such delights was very cheering and a party to the new day of the funeral mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwaring civility that they were perfectly needless as they walked home elizabeth related to jane which he had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended neither on both that they appeared to be in the wrong she could no more explain such behavior than her sister mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennett by admiring mrs phillipss manners and politeness he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen her woman she had not only received him with the utmost civility but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before something hes opposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention and the whole course of his life and of

reading by annie coleman in st louis missouri on december 11 2005 pride and prejudice by jane austen chapter 16 as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their arms and all mr collins scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennett for a single evening during his visit for most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to maryton and the girl had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing room that mr wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mr stark was speaking to him about her and he was at the partys work when she had listened to the church one of lady catherines drawing rooms and found that the chimney piece alone had cost 800 pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeepers room in the striping chair all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion the occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentleman joined them and he found in mrs phillips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbors who were not listening to their cousin and you had nothing to do with which for an instrument and a remnant of their own indifferent imitations as chinas uniformity the interval of waiting to hear very long to the overappel of her husband the gentleman did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration the officers of the shire were in general a very credible gentleman like set and the best of them of the present party but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as they were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle phillips bringing part wine followed them into the room mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female i was hurt and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner and which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night manter feel that the communist dullest most red bear topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker mr wickham was not a single person very desperate for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the officers the young lady shes certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals the kindlookinger in mrs phillips and was by her watchfulness most upundantly supplied with coffee and shampoo when the party dabled her plate he had the opportunity of obligating her chair by staying there to a toast he did a little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for my situation in life mrs phillips was very glad for his compliance but could not wait for his reason mr wickham did not play at wist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia at first there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a mustdetermant to talk her but being likewise really well and longer he came in he grew too much interested in the game too eager to make bets and explaining everything he has attention for anyone in particular allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told his story as his acquaintance was mr karsey she dared not even mention that gentleman her curiosity however was unexpectedly weak mr wickham began the subject himself he acquired roughhearted bill boyle in the american and after receiving her answer asked in a hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property and darcys sheetor i understand yes replied mr wickham his estate there is a number one a clear 10000 per annum you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy elizabeth could not but looked at that you may welcome her to spend it at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very called manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcy as much as i ever wished to be pridal elizabeth very warmly i have spent four days in the same process as him and i think him very disagreeable i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me to be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express a quite so strongly anywhere else here you are in your own family upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighborhood except another field he is not at all liked and hurt for cheer everybody is disgusted with his pride he will not find him more favorably spoken of by anyone i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their beliefs but with him i believe it does not often happen the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and see some only as he chooses to be seen i should take him even on my flight acquaintance to be an l tempered man i will come from the show of his life i will wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer why do you not at all know that i heard nothing of his going away when i was in never field i hope your plans in favor of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighborhood oh no it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim before all the world a sense of very great illusive and most painful regrets at his being what he is his father ms bennett the land mr darcy was one of the best men that ever breed and the truest friend that ever had and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections his behavior to myself has been scandalous but i very believe i could forgive him anything and everything rather than his disappointing hopes and discracing the memory of his father elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry mr wicken began to speak on more general topics mariton the neighborhood the society of hearing highly fluently with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable core and my friends daddy tempted me further by his account of their personal quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances and maryten had procured them society i own is necessary to me i have been a discraced man and my spirit from not being a fault for him and must have employment and society a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living at a free good gentleman who was speaking of just now indeed yes the late mr darcy bequeefed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to me i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere good heavens cried elizabeth but how could that be how could his will be disregarded why did you not seek legal repressed there was just such an incomality in the terms of the request as to give me no hope from law a man of honor could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeit all claim to it by extravagant and prudent in short anything or nothing certain is aayse that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i may have spoken my opinion of him and to him to freely i can recall nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced sometime a rather he will be the child that he will be i think if you get his father i can never defy or expose him elizabeth honored him for such feelings and thought him handsome or than ever as he expressed them but what he said after cause but has been his muscles what could have induced him to behave so cruelly a thorough determined dislike is me a dislike which i cannot put a treat in some measure to jelly i belate mr garcia like me less the sun might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not attempted to bear the sort of competition in which we stood sort of preference because often given me i had not thought mr garcia so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill at him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at another field of the impackability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must be flexible i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardly be just to him elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner that gods son the friend the favorite of his father she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contended herself with and one too who had probably been his companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner we were born in the same parish weve been the same part the greatest part of our youth was passed together in the midst of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr phillips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up everything to be a views to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the family including he was most fond of seeing the by mr darcy the most intimate confidential friend mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendent and when immediately before my fathers death mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me im convinced that he felt it to be a blessing that his father took the pin as ive with the fact that hes my self thats strange right elizabeth how abominable i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonest he i must call it it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride had often been his best friend it has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling but we are none of us consistent and in his behavior to me there were stronger impulses even than pride can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenant and to relieve the poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace the family to degenerate from the popular qualities for whom he includes what the plumberly house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers what sort of girl is mr c he shook his head i wish i could call her any more it gives me pain to speak ill of an rc but she is too much like her brother very very proud of the child she is a passionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have to go to hours to part and listen she is nothing to me now she is the handsome girl about 15 or 16 and i understand highly accomplished she is her fathers death her home has been london where lady lives with her and super intense her education after many causes and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help working once more to the first and saying i am astonished that his intimacy with mr bingley look at mr bingley he seems good humor itself and is i really believe truly eniable in friendship with such a man how can they speak each other do you know mr bingley not at all he is a sweet tempered eniable charming man he cannot know what mr darcy is probably not but mr darcy can please where he chooses he does not bond abilities he can be a conversable companion if he thinks it worth his while among those who are at all his equals and consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the last prosperous his pride never deserves it but with the rich his liberal minded just sincere rational unirable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune in figure the list party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs phillips the youth will increase as to his success was made by the latter it had not been very great he had lost every point when mrs phillips began to express her concern there pun he is shurker with much earnest gravity that it was not for these two fortunes that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged that she would not make herself uneasy i know very well madam said he that one person sit down to a car table they must take their chances of these things and happily i am not in touch with stances as to make five shillings from the object darcy undoubtedly many who cannot say the same but thankfully the clapping of the board i am the new car and then a necessity for the part of the little matters mr wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr collins for a few moments the asthal is a bit an aloe voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of the board lady captain the board shurkwai has very lately given the living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long you know of course that lady catherine de bourg and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the front of mr darcy now indeed i did not i knew nothing at all lady catherines connection i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday her daughter mr bourg will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite to a state this information made me so much smile as she thought of poor ms bingley vain indeed must be all her attentions vane and useless her affection for this sister and her praise with himself if you were already selfdust in for another mr collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related her lady ship i suspect his gratitude mislead him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceded woman i believe this is a beautiful and a great degree who replied but him i have not seen her so many dreams but i dare not remember if i never left her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and sliver but i rather believe she derives her ability to her right and fortune her protector her authority tative men are and the rest from the pride for her nephew who chooses that everyones connected with him should have an understanding of the first class elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational count of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction to suffer for an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr whitmans attention there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs phillips separate party but his manners recommended him to everybody whatever he said was said well and whatever he did run gracefully elizabeth went away with her head full of him she could think of nothing but of mr whitman and the hotkey had told her all the way home there was not time for her even conventions name as they went for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent lydia talked incessantly of watery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr collins in describing the stability of mr and mrs phillips protesting that he did not and the least regard his losses at waste enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longborn house and of chapters 16 chapter 17 a little bit delayed to jane next day what a pass between mr whitman herself jane was suddenly astonished and concerned she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so in worthy of mr benglish regard and yet it was not in the nature to question the veracity of a young man of such a imibable parents as whitman the possibility of his having endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing remained before to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained they have both said shed been deceived i dare say in some way or other all she can form no idea interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side very true indeed and now my jane what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody life is much as you choose but you will not laugh me out of my opinion my dear slyzi do but consider in what a disgraceful life it placed mr darcy to be treating his fathers favorite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for it is impossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character to be capable of it and hes lost intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him oh no i can much more easily believe mr bing is being imposed on the nat mr wicker which didnt vent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every convention without ceremony if hed been up so but mr darcy contradicted besides there was truth in his looks it is difficult indeed it is distressing one does not know what to think ill take you part of the music that we want but you have to think of certainty on only one point that mr bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery for the conversation passed by the arrival of a very close little girl who had been speaking mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the longexpected ball at another field which was fixed for the following tuesday the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again calling it an age since they had met and repeatedly asking what she had been doing with herself since their separation to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs bennett as much as possible pay much too elizabeth and nothing at all to the others they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took care of her by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennetts civility the prospect of another field ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family mrs bennett chose to consider it as given compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of a ceremony as card jane makes sure to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wiffon and of seeing a confirmation of everything when mr barshers look and behavior im happy to meet mrs bennetts very happy and familiar if youd less than anything more than for any for the full person for both of the each like elizabeth meant to dance has to eat ling with mr wiffon he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and the ball was at any rate of all and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it while i cant have my mornings to myself said she it is enough i think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement and desirable for everybody elizabeths spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins she could not help but ask me him whether he intended to accept mr bingleys invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evening engagements and she was out of surprise to find that he entertained to know scribble whatever on that head and was very far from dreading every bug either from the archbishop on lady catherine de bores by venturing to dance i am by no means of the opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honored with the hands of all my parents how they do the course of the evening and i think the opportunity of soliciting yours mr elizabeth for the first two dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her elizabeth felt herself completely taken in shes not fully pursuing seeing any great fun mr elizabeth come for those very dances and having to make your comments instead the liveliness had never been worst timed there was no help for it however mr whickhams happiness came for all whickhams wish to lay for the woman mr collins proposed a little accepted with as good a grace as she could she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of hunts for percentage and of assisting before an acquired real people at roadings in the absence of more eligible visitors the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civility toward herself and her desire to be able to attempt to complement on her with the new vasude and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage will extremely agree about her elizabeth however did not choose to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the concept of any reply mr collins might never make the offer until he did it was useless to quarrel about him if there had not been another field ball to prepare for and talk of the younger misspenets would have been in a very prettyable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of great as prevented their walking to marry to once no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very shoe roses for another field were got by proxy even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patients in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr witton and nothing less than the dance on tuesday would have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday indorable to kitty and lydia and of chapter 17 this is a librevox recording all librevox recordings are in the public domain for more information or to volunteer please visit librevoxorg today is reading by kara schellenberg wwwkraorg pride and prejudice by jane austen and 19 chapter 18 till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr witton among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her she had dressed with more than you would have here and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubbed in his heart trusting that it was not more than might be one in the course of the evening but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darsis pleasure in the big liaison to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact that his absence was pronounced by his friend denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that witton had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darsi was not less answerable for wittons absence than if her first surmise had been charged every feeling of this pleasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make attendance forbearance patients with darsi was injury to witton she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humor which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr dreaming who was blind partiality for her but elizabeth was not formed for ill humor and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirit and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice the first two dances however brought to return of distress they were dances of mortification mr collins awkward and solemn apologizing instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shards and misery which a disagreeable part of her for a couple of dances can give the moment of her release from him was ecstasy she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of witton and of hearing that he was universally liked when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mine charlotte tried to console her i dare say you will find him very agreeable heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all too fine to man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil when the dancing recommends however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be as simple as him and allow her fancy for witton to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived and being allowed to stand opposite mr darcy and reading in her neighbors looks their equal amazement in beholding it they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and that first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fanciing that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance he replied and was again silent after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and by im a observed private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may silence do you talk by rule then while you are dancing sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some on the same time they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine both replied elizabeth archley before i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclots of a proverb this is no very striking resemblance of your own character im sure said he how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly i must not decide on my own performance oh he made no answer and they were again silent until they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to mary she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance the effect was immediate a deeper shade of hater overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on at length darcy spoke and an constrained manner said mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of repeating him is less certain he has been so unlucky as to those your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life darcy made no answer and seemed desireless of changing the subject at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr darcy he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner i have been most hearted gratified indeed my dear sir such very superior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you will belong to the first circles now we can say however that your fair mind is not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear eliza blunting at her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to mr darcy but let me not interrupt sir you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also abrading me the longer part of this address was especially heard by darcy but sir williams allegiance to his friend seemed to strengthen forceably and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are talking about next i cannot imagine what thing do you have books said he is smiling book oh no i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different opinions no i cannot talk of books in a ballroom my head is always full of something else the present always occupies you in such scenes does it said he with a look of doubt yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly explaining remember hearing you once said mr dazzi that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created i am said he with a firm voice and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice i hope not it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first may i ask to what these questions tend immediately to the illustration of your character said she endeavoring to shake off her gravity i am trying to make it out and what is your success she shook her head i do not get on at all i hear such a different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly i can readily believe and so he gravely that reports may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennett that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he called me replied she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence and on each side this satisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcys breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her she was so sure that her heart and directed all her anger against another they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil this day a constant her so miss and i i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you among his other communication that he was the son of old wickham the late mr darcys steward let me recommend you however as a friend not to give him implicit confidence to all his assertion for as to mr darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has always been remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he has taken himself out of the way his coming into the country at all is the most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it i pity you mr liza for this discovery of your favorite to guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said he elizabeth angerly for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcys steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself i beg your pardon replied mr bingley turning away with a smear excuse my interference it was kindly meant insolent girl that he was a bit to herself you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a poultry attack as this i see nothing in it but your own willful ignorance mr darcy she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment elizabeth appeared for wickham recently against his enemies and everything else gave way before the hope of janes being embarrassed way for happiness i want to know said she what you have learned to not mr wickham but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon no reply jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honor of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sisters mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcys regard mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself well we never saw him till the other morning at marathon this account then is what he has received from mr darcy i am satisfied but what does he say of the living he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only i have not adopted mr bingleys sincerity said he elizabeth wormley but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurance is only mr bingleys defense of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learned the rest from that friend himself i shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as i did before she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment elizabeth listens with delight to the happy though modest hopes which change every kind of thing means regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it on their being joined by this livingly himself he lives a path with drew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exaltation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honors of the house the names of his cousin mr bullard and of her mother lady catherine how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine deburg in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy indeed i am i shall entreat his part for not having done it earlier i believe him to be lady catherines nephew it will be in my power to assure him that her lady ship was quite well yesterdays midnight elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an important and freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must be long to mr darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance mr collins listening her with a determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony among the lit and those which regulate the clergy for given me the need to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behavior is at the same time maintained you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual studying to decide then a young lady like yourself and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident her cousin preface in the suite with a solid bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsburg and lady catherine gibberg it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man mr darcy was eyeing him like understained oneders and pointed at last mr collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility mr collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr darcys content seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way mr collins then returned to elizabeth i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with your attention he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so welcome vince to lady catherines discernment as to be certain she could never be still a favor unworthy it was really a very handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane she saw her in ideas settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could be stole and she felt capable and her such circumstances other than them even to like bingleys two sisters her mothers thoughts between the saw were against this in the way and she literally did not venture near me last she might hear too much when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverse in which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vaksed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon be married to mr bingley it was an animating subject and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while numerating the advantages of the man his being such a charming young man and so rich and living about three miles from them were the first points of selfgraduation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as my she could for it was more over a such a promising thing for her younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently at triumphant there was no chance of it in vain did he las a bath endeavor to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her forlessly and a less audible whisper for to reinexplicable vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear for heavens sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be for you to offend mr darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing nothing that she could say however had any influence her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone he elizabeth blushed and blushed again shane vexation she could not help wickly glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of her who had read it for though he was always laying out her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity at length however mrs bennett had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken when was the batching album again to revive but not long was the interval of tranquility for when several was over singing was taught of them and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little injury to her preparing to oblige the company by many significant looks on silent interviews that she endeavored to prevent such a proof of her places but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched the press through several stands that have been very ill rewarded at their close so mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed onto favorliming in as to the cause of half a minute began another marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected elizabeth was in agonies she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very compulsively talking to bingley she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however imperturbably grave she looked at her father to treat his interference thus mary should be singing on night he took the hint and if mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child you have delighted us long enough let the other young ladies and gentlemen to exhibit there though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerting and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good others of the party were now applied to if i said mr collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in a bludging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to the rector of a parish has much to do in the first place he must make such an agreement for tives as maybe beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused for making as comfortable as possible and as youve got to think that in the light of the day i usually have a can do that i like the day manner towards everybody especially towards those to whom he owes his performance i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should emit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room many stared many smiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennett himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man two illegal baths appeared that had the family made and agreed to exposed themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for the partner parts with more spirit or finer success and happy that she thanked it for being me and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that i feel that were not of a sport to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed that his two sisters and mr darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insulant smiles of the ladies were more intolerable the rest of the evening brought her little amusement she was teased by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others in reindigee and treatment to stand up as somebody else and also to introduce him to any young lady in her home he assured more that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening there was no arguing upon such a project she owed her greatest relief to the three exlipers who often joined them and good naturedly engaged mr collins conversation to herself she was at least free from the offence of mr darcys further notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged who never came near enough to speak she felt it to be the probable consequence of her illusions to mr wickham and rejoiced in it the longborn party were the last of all accompanied to depart and by a maneuver of mrs bennett had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone which gave them time to see how hard her face was to wish me by some of the family mrs hurst and her sisters scarcely opened their mouths except to complain to the police and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves they repulsed every attempt of mrs bennett at conversation and by so doing through a langer over the whole party which was very little relief by the long speeches of mr collins who was confident in mr bailey and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behavior to their guests darcy said nothing at all mr bennett in equal silence was enjoying the scene mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other he was a bath preserve to a steady silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am accompanied by a violent yon when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennett was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longborn and addressed herself especially to mr bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation dingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whether he was obliged to go the next day for a short time mrs bennett was perfectly satisfied and which of the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netted field in the course of three or four months of having another daughter married to mr cullin she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure evas a bath was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield and of chapter 18 chapter 19 mr collins made his declaration in form having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of dividends to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he said about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed to regular part of the business on finding mrs bennett evas a bath and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter evas a bath when i solicit for the honor of a private audience with her in the course of this morning before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise mrs bennett answered instantly oh dear yes certainly i am sure lizzie will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you upstairs and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out dear madam do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuse me he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not here i am going away myself no no nonsense lizzie i desire you to stay where you are and upon elizabeths seating really with a vexed and embarrassed gloves about to escape she added lizzie i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moments consideration making her also sensible but it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion mrs bennett and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr collins began believe me my dear miss elizabeth that youre modestly so far from doing you any diservice rather adds to your other perfections you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mothers permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however you are a natural delicacy and need you to disemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it would be advisable for me to stake my reason for marrying and moreover for coming into her furniture with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did the idea of mr collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think that a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honor of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hansford between our pools at quadril while mrs jenkinson was arranging mr voras footstool that she said mr collins you must marry a clergyman like you must marry choose properly choose a gentle woman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hansford and i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de burg as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond anything i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention and favor of natural men it remains to be told why my views were directed towards longborn instead of my own neighborhood where i can assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honored father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains but for me to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that £1000 in the 4 percent which will not be yours till after your mothers disease is all that you may ever be entitled on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now you are too hasty sir she cried you forget that i have made no answer let me do it without further loss of the time accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honor of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise then to decline them i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he applies for their favor and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar heirlong upon my words sir cried elizabeth your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked the second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world with the next move so may where your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect itll qualify for the situation were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr collins very gravely but i cannot imagine that her lady ship would at all this approve of you and you may be certain when i have the honor of seeing her again i shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand you all in my power to prevent your being otherwise in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longborn estate whenever it falls without any selfreproach this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled and rising as she thus spoke she would have quit the room head mr collins not thus addressed her when i do myself the honor of speaking to the nexthand subject i shall hope to receive a more favorable answer you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character really mr collins cried in the same form you puzzle me exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal is merely words of course my reasons for believing in our briefly means it does not appear to be that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections with the family of deborne and my relationship to your own our circumstances highly in my favor and you should take it into further consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made of your portion is unhappy so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females i do assure you sir that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere i thank you again and again for the honor you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect forbid it can i speak a planer do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to play a few but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward garantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals were not fail of being acceptable to such persons words in the will for selfdeception you miserable would make no reply and immediately and in silence with drew determined if he persisted in considering her painted her fuzzles as fluttering in courage to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive and whose behavior at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and cocategory of an elegant female end of chapter 19 recorded on november 6 2005 in august of july this is a librevox recording all

austen chapter 20 mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love from mrs bennett having dalled about in the vestibuoto watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick steps past her towards the staircase then she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and then genuine delicacy of her character this information however startled mrs bennett she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and she could not help saying so but to pin upon it mr collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason i will speak to her about it myself directly she is a very headstrong and i will make her know it pardon me for interrupting you madam crying to collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would all together be a very desirable wife to amand in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it would better not to force her into acceptable she could not contribute much to my felicity so quite misunderstood me lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these in everything else she is as good nature to girl as a perluent i will go directly to mr bennett and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure she would not give him time to reply but herring instigated her husband called out as she entered the library oh mr bennett i wanted an idea yeah we are all all up all i must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her and fix the man her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech of what are you talking of mr collins and lizzy lizzy declares she will not have mr collins and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy and what am i to do on this occasion i will see the hopelessness speak to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you will sister point her marry him let her be called down she shall hear my voice mrs bennett rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library come here child better father as she appeared i have sent for you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage is it true it was met through time that it was very well and this offer of marriage you have refused i have very well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your accepting it is it not so mrs bennett yes what i will never see her again and on a happy alternative its before you elizabeth from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again if you do elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs bennett who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed what do you mean mr bennett why talking in this way you promised me to insist upon her marrying them my dear replied her husband i have two small favors to request first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as maybe not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband didnt mrs bennett give up the point she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns she endeavoured to see her and her interest but she possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaity replied to her attacks though her manner varied however her determination never did mr collins mean was meditating in solitude on what had passed he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them she was met in the vestibule by lydia flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad youll come for there is such fun here what do you think has happened this morning mr collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where mrs bennett was alone then she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and in treating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wish of her family pray to my dear miss lucas she added in a meloncholentone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am truly used nobody feels for my porners charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth i there she comes continue mrs bennett look look at us im concerned as maybe there you go more for us than if we were a joke provided she could have her own way but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing a real hard marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i will show i do not know but mr maintain you when your father is dead i shall not be able to keep you and so i wont you i have done with you from this very day i told you in the library who know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as well as my one i have no pleasure talking to a beautiful children not that i have much pleasure indeed im talking to anybody the people who suffer as i do the more the same things can have no great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i suffer but it is always so those who do not complain ill never pity her daughter is listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or sue her would only increase the irritation she talked on therefore without a corruption for any of them till they were joined by mr collins we entered with an error more stately than mr collins and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr collins admit that we have a little conversation together elizabeth asked why he had gone jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground to turn into her or she could and charlotte detained first by the facility of mr collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minimal and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself before talking to the window in between in a dull voice mrs bennett thus began the projected conversation mr collins my dear madam replied he let us be in for better silence on this point far be it for me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure present the behavior of your daughter resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned perhaps the not less so from feeling adult to my positive happiness had my cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation he will not i hope consider me as showing any disrespect to your family am i dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughters favor without having paid yourself and misrevent it the compliment of requesting you to impose your authority in my behalf my condoled man i fear be objectionable in having accepted my decision from your daughters lips instead of your own but we are all liable to error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of old your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i hear a big leave to apologise end of chapter 20 this is a librevox recording only brevox recordings are allowed to lean for more information on that please visit librevoxorg we are the quick ones its shields pride and prejudice by jane austen chapter 21 the discussion of mr collins office was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some people who are not as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or rejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence he scarcely ever spoke to her and the residuals of tensions were chiefly and so sensed to love himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas her civility in miss victorian was a seasonable relief to the mall and especially to her friend the moro produced no big hit of mrs bennetts or in la mr collins was also in the same state of anger pride aaaaaaa elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least effected by it he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still must stay after breakfast the girls walked to meriton to inquire if mr wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were well talked over to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been selfimposed i found said he as the time drew a little that i had better not meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself she highly appealed to his forebearance and they had led her through full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they severely bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longborn and during the walk he particularly attended to her his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the complimented offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennett it came from netherfield and was opened immediately the envelope contained a sheer neglect well to make his fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intent around some particular passages jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew her to her then a glance from jane invited her to follow her upstairs when the head came for jane taking out her letter said and this is from caroline dingley or did containers are surprised to me the wall party have left another field by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again you shall hear what she says she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to die in that day in grovener street where mr hurst had a house the next was in his voice i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in hartfordshire except for her society my dear friend but we will help i shall have to return i shall have many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence i depend on you for that to these highflown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of the enormous surprise she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingleys being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane masoon ceased to regard it in the introverted years it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which ms bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known is friends the renewed with yet greater satisfaction as this time mr bingley will not be the kind of immortal writer caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into heart for sure this winter i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday in the midst of the business which all interworld are not particularly important is we of four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him the other the team may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the crowd but of that i despair i sincerely hope your christmas in heart for sure may abound in the gateys which that season generally brings and a threat your bow will be sent mr prevent your feeding balls it is evident by this at a time that he comes back no more this winter it is only evident that nespengly does not mean he should why do you think so it must be his own doing he is his own master but you do not know i will need you the passage which particularly i will have no results for you mr dorsey is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do think george r dorsey has her equal for beauty and the girls image and the affection she inspires in louisia and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being here after our sister i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to whom i feel as a person but i would not leave the country without you and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable my brother greatly admires her already he will have frequent opportunity now relations always the connection as much as his owner and a sisters partiality is not misleading when i pulled charles a nurse to keep a vacation to anyones home hes going to be a circumstances to favor an attachment indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many what do you think you of this sentence my dear lizzy said jane as she finished it is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of our brothers in difference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my go can there be any other opinion on the subject yes there can for mine is totally different will you hear it mist willingly you shall have it in a few words miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants to marry the stops she follows him to town and will keep you there im trying to persuade you that you deserve to hear about her too jane sugarhead indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt us miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simple to me could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is this we are not rich enough or a grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get mr darcy far brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if mr berigwout of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest great less sensible of your merit and when he took leave a view on tuesday or that it would be in her power to persuade him i didnt step in being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend if we thought like of miss bingley replied jane her representation will this might make me quite easy but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wulfillied deceiving anyone and all that i can hope for in this case is that she is deceived herself that is right you could not have stated a more happy idea since you were not here believe her to be deceived by all means you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer but my dearest sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry a swear you must decide for yourself set a list of it and if upon the trod to the berigwout you find that the misery of disablaging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife my advisor by all means you are confusing how can you talk so say jane faithless my life you must know that the thrash of the two sisters have earned their disarperation i could not hesitate i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required a thousand things may arise in six months the idea of his returning no more elizabeth triggered with the utmost content it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines interest at wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone she represented her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect janes temper was not despondent and she was gradually led to hope though the dividends of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to another field and answer every wish of her heart they agreed that mrs bench should only hear partial family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewildered it as exceedingly all the things that the ladies should have been to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at long ball and the conclusion of all was the comfortable decoration that there had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses end of chapter 21 chapter 22 the benets were engaged to dying with the locuses and again during the chief of the day was ms lucas so calm and stood as soon as mr collins elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her it keeps him in good humor said she shared her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this was very unique but charlottes come with extended father than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr collins dresses by engaging her towards her such a person who could succeed and appearances were so favorable that when they parted success if he had not been leaving heart for sure so very soon but here she did an injustice to the fire of the independence of the scarlet for it led him to escape at long ball house the next morning had a little silence that he sent to lucas for all which to throw himself at her feet he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt to know until its success could be known likewise for the feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively difficult since the eventual wednesday his reception however was of the most flattering kind miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane but little had she dared to hope that so much love and elephants awaited her there in as short a time as mr collinss long speeches would allow everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entrusted her to name the day that was to make him the happiest men and theres such a solicitation must be waived for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness the stupidity with which he was favored by nature must guard his courtship from any child that could make a woman wish for his continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an astonishing carenothouse and a pastevident working so william and lady lucas were speedled by the judge for their consent and it must be still with the most joyful lacquerity mr collins present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give beautiful sheep and his prospects to future wealth were exceeding the same lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excite in before how many years longer mr bennett was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longborn estate it would be highly expedient that with he and his wife should make their appearance at st james the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes dying painmade charlotte herself was taller at the contest she had gained her point and had time to consider of it her reflections were in general satisfactory mr collins to be sure the younger sense of her his society was her concern and his attachment to her must be imaginary but still he would be her husband without thinking highly i dont have men or a matrimon now it had always been her opportunity it was the only honorable provision for welleducated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of 27 without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise at most occasion to an isabelle fennel whose friendship she valent to be on that of any other person elizabeth worked and taught her the pain her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disarputation she resigned to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longborn to dinner to drop new hint of what had passed before any of the family upon some secrecy it was of course very doodily given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence first full and such a very direct question on his return as required some intrusive attitude to living and he was at the same time exercising great selfdenial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love as he was to begin his journey early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and his sentence was great polite and cordiality said how happy he should be to see him at longborn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive do you maybe very certain that i should have been the advice that i have had with this person they were all astonished and mr bennett who could buy no means which for so speedy or return immediately said but is there not danger of lady catherines disarparation you have been neglecting relations than run the risk of offending a patchless my dear sir we applied mr collins i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking pleasure and i am merely a ships come close you cannot be too much on your guard risk anything rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly powerful stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offense believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affection at attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from the a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hartfordshire as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not accepting my cousin elizabeth with proper civility is the ladies then with drew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return mrs bennett wished understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to more to bring up her and married accept him she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read an improved self by such an example of his service he might become a very agreeable companion but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away ms lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before the possibility of mr collins found seeing himself in love with a friend and once occurred to elizabeth within the last day but the child could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of the form i should stop crying out and gauge to mr collins by do a short possible the steady countenance which ms lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving sir direct of a pro though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think its incredible that mr collins should be able to do that because he was not so happy to be here elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness i see what you were feeling a prior child you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mr collins was wishing between you have time to think it all in i hope you can be satisfied with what i said i never was i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collinss character connections in situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people proposed on entering the marriage state elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth has very much left to reflect on what she did her it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match the strangeness of mr collins making too often as a marriage within three days was nothing in comparison with his being now accepted she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage charlotte the wife of mr collins was a most 280 picture and to the pang of a friend discracing herself in something new was added the dispressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lock she had chosen and of chapter 22 this is a librevox recording all librevox

elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorized to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to an exadagement department with many compliments to them and much selfcongratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses and unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but in credulous and this is bad and more precedents than close things protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often unsill moisturously exclaimed good lord so william how can you tell such a story do you not know that mr collins wants to know a lazy nothing less than the complacence of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried in his room and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinents with the most for bearing courtesy elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant situation now put herself forward confirms that he wrote by mentioning her prior knowledge of from short herself and endeavored to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the exiled character of mr collins and the convenant distance of hansford from london mrs bennett was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent in the first knees she was supposed to be believing the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off two inferences however were plainly deduced from home one that elizabeth was the real plays in the mixture and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelled during the rest of the day nothing could console and nothing appease her nor did that day were out her resentment a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter mr bennetts emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover the charlatan lucas whom he had used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish that his daughter jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her honest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as a probable kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at maritum lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph and being able to retort on mrs bennett a comfort of having a daughter well married and she called it longborn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mrs bennetts sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been enough to draw between elizabeth and charlie there was a restraint in which the mutual insight was entered and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again her disappointment and charlie over time delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been born a week and nothing was heard at his return jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again the promised letter of thanks for mr collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a 12 months abode with the family might have prompted after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbor that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at law with her people for lady catherine he had it so heartily approved his marriage that she wished to take this as soon as possible and she trusted her would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men mr collins returned into her workshop and will bring pleasure to his people on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband it was very strange that he should come to longborn instead of lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome she hated having visitors in the house where her health was certain different and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable such with a gentle murmur as a mrs bennett and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingleys continued absence neither jane nor elizabeth was comfortable on the subject day after day passed away without bringing any other dreams then the report would shortly prevailed in marathon of his coming no more to another field the whole winter a report quietly in some excuses found in which she never failed to comprehend as a most scandal of spalsuit even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his two sisters would be successful in keeping her on really she was to admit an idea so destructive to janes happiness and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring the united efforts of his two unfelung sisters and of an overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of ms rossi and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment as for jane her anxiety and this suspense was of course more painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desireless of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to but his new such days his new past in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very illused it needed all janes steady mildest very visàvis attacks were horrible to her mr collins returned most pensionally on the monday for a land but his reception at longborn was not so gracious as it had been on his first introduction he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longborn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed mrs bennett was really in a most pitiful state for her much of anything concerning the match through her into an agony of illhumour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of the sight of mrs lucas was odious to her as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous applause whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that they were talking of the longborn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennett was dead she complained bitterly of all this to her husband indeed mr bennett said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mr sopthis house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hurt the fouryearold let us flatter ourselves maybe the survivor this was not very consoling to mrs bennett and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before i could not bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was not for the entail i should not mind it what should you not mind i should not mind anything at all that is be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility i can never be thankful mr bennett about the entail how anyone could have the conscience to entail the way in a state from ones own daughters i can have understand that all for the sake of mr collins too why should he have it more than anybody else i leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennett end of chapter 23 miss pinkleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their allbeing settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brothers regret had not having had done to his list of stressconsumption of the entire family hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort this glass of pearls were put on her many intentions were again blowtongue and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of mr darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture elizabeth to whom jane very soon silent in dignation her heart was divided between concern and sister in the same family to find my decision her brothers being partial to the stars image that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easyness of temper that want to turn into a new fan which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their creations had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best but her sisters was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long and dodged and must be unevaled he could think of nothing else and yet whether bingleys regard had really died away or his supposed friends and interference whether he had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained the same her peace equally wounded a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs bennetts leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about another field and its master she could not help saying oh but my dear mother had more command over herself she could have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him but i will not repy it cannot last long but her he will be forgot and be sure for her being as we were before in this battle to her sister with her fragile selfesteem but said nothing you doubt me cried jane slightly coloring indeed you have no reason he may live in my memory as the most amiable mind i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with i dont go i have not done that a little time therefore i shall certainly try with the strong of those she soon met me i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error or fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself my dear jane exclaim to lisbon you are too good your sweetness and disinterestedness are feeling anxious i do not know what to say to you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve miss bennett eagerly disclaim to all extraordinary merit and through back the praise on her sisters warm affection nay settle this but this is not fair you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak in any body i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal goodwill you need not there are few people who might really love and still fewer of them can be ready the more i see of the world the more i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependents that can be placed on the appearance of my dear persons im led with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlottes marriage it is unaccountable every view it is unaccountable i do this just a choice they will ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for a difference of situation and temper consider mr collins respectability and charlottes preblost remember that she is one of the large families that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for everybody who says that she may feel something like the gold and a steam for another cousin to a blind jew i would try to believe almost anything but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for right persuaded the trotter to be a gold for him she had only think worse so her understanding that i now do a far farther my dear jane mr collins is a conceited pompous narrow mind in silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavor to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prunes and in sensibility of danger security for happiness i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and you can be convinced that if i see you and happen together but enough of this you alluded to something else you mentioned two instances i cannot understand you but i am treated you lizzie not to be able to be a victim of that person to blame and say you are a pinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but our ability to see us as women fancy admiration means more than it is and men take care that they should but if it is designed just a little bit so much design in the world as some persons imagine i am far from attributing any part of mr bingleys conduct to design certainly lizzie but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness want of attention to other peoples feelings and want a resolution will do the business and do you want to give it to others yes to the last but if i go on i shall just please you by saying what i think of persons you as theme stop me wills to come you will persist then in supposing his sisters influence him yes in conjunction with his friend i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can only wish for his happiness and if he is attached to me your first position is false they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride beyond the doubt they do wish him to choose mr starcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers unless there was something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me are most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slothed it is bad that the girls are all i should be they can be a pair of sisters but we took all the best thing in the light in which it may be understood elizabeth could not oppose such anish and from this time mr bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them mrs bennett still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and there were days seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less complexity her daughter endeavored to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her anymore but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day mrs bennetts best comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer mr bennett treated her like a fool so lizzy said he one day her sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions when is your turn to come hard bear to be long outdone by jane now is your time here are our officers enough at meriton to disappoint all the young ladies in the county let a wick and be your man he is a present fellow and would joke you creditably thank you sir but at less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect janes good fortune true said mr bennett but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may be following you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it hey mr wickhams society was a material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the farmborn for a while they saw the most and to raise other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvased and everybody was pleased to hear which they had always disliked mr darcy before they had an anything in this case he was the only future that stands there might be any of the stardom circumstances in his case unarmed to the society of art for sure her mild and steady candle all was thated for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men and a chapter 24 chapter 25 after a week spent in profession these vile vines comes a facetine mr collins was called for his email show aaaaaaah saturday the pain of separation wait that the evade of this satellite repression is for the such it is bright as he had reasoned to hope but shortly after his next retooned to hop the day would be fixed that was to make the happiest of me to the evil of his relations at our bed with as much solemnity as before wished his fear cousins health pathing us again and promised their father another letter of thanks on the followinmunday mrs bennett had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longborn mr gardner was a sensible gentleman like man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view his own warehouses could have been so wellbred mrs collins who was subdued as an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favorite with all her longborn nieces between the two elders and herself especially theyre subsisted a very particular regard they had frequently been staying with her in town the first part of mrs gardners business on her arrival was to distribute her presence and describe the newest fashions when this was done she had a less active part to play it became her turn to listen mrs bennett had many grievances to relate and much to complain of they were very very weak such a large subsurface two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr bingley if she could but lizzie i was sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collins wife by this time i did not then for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longborn estate is just as much entailed as ever the locuses are very artful people in the sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbors who think of themselves before anybody else however you are coming just at this time as the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleep this is god the only chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned to conversation when alone with elizabeth after this she spent more than the center it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane is it i am sorry to but these things have so often a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accidents separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent an excellent consequence she knew its worth settle this with but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade young man of independent orchor to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before but that expression of violently in love is so hackneed so doubtful so indefinite but it gives me very little idea it is as often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hours of acquaintance as to a real strong attachment pray a violent wasnis to bingleys love i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite in attempt to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time they met it was more decided or remarkable at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer this is not a gentle incident a very essence of love oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor jean i am sorry for her because with such a disposition she may not get over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzie you would have laughed yourself out of its sooner but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home maybe as useful as anything elizabeth was exceeding he pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sisters ready atleast this is gardner that no consideration with regard to the young man will influence her we live in so different a part of town what are our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless you really come to see her and that is quite impossible for he has now in the custody of his friend and mr darcy would know more about her and call on jean in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as grace church street but he would hardly think a months solution enough to cleanse in public securities ready once to act right and depend upon it mr bingley never stirs without him so much to that i hope they will not be at all but does jean not correspond to with the sister she will not be able to help calling she will drop the acquaintance entirely but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless it was possible and sometimes she thought it probably that his affection might be really amateur and the influence of his friend successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes attractions ms bennett accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time then as she hoped that by carolyns not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him the gardeners stayed a week at longborn and what with the philipses the lucass and the officers there was not a day without its engagement mrs bennett had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner when the engagement was for home some of the laws needs were not in the hall but officers mr wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs gardener rendered suspicious by elizabeths warm commendations of him now only observed them both without supposing them for what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she was all to speak to elizabeth on this subject before she left her for sure and represented to her the importance of encouraging such an attachment to mrs gardener wickham had one means of a forwarding pleasure unconnected with his general powers about 10 or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of darbys show to which he belonged they had therefore many acquaintance in common and the wickham had been little there since the death of darcys father five years ago it was yet in his family to give her fashion and intelligence of her former friends then she had been in the way of procuring mrs gardener had seen pemberley and known that wickham stood on sea by character perfectly well here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse in comparing her collection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham would give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting her film at the same time unbeying made acquainted with the present mr darcys treatment of him she tried to remember something about her marriage repeated disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and his confident at last that she recollected having her mr fitzwilliam darcy formally spoken of as a very proud unatured boy end of chapter 25 this is a librevox recording all librevox recordings are in the public domain for more information or to volunteer visit librevoxorg pride and prejudice by jane austen chapter 26 mrs gardeners passion to a visit was punctual and kind to give an on the first paperable opportunity of speaking to her own after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl was he to fall in love merely because youre going to dance to it and therefore im not afraid of speaking openly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involve yourself or endeavor to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very important i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is you must not let yourself in that way you have sex and we all struggle to do this your father would depend on your resolution in good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father randy rads is being serious indeed yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise well then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it the elizabeth youre not serious now i beg your pardon ill try it again at present i am not in love with mr wickham no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man and if he becomes really attached to me i will believe it better that he should not i see the improvements of it honourable mr darcy my fathers opinion of me does the greatest honor and i should be miserable to forfeit it my father however is partial to mr wickham in short my dear it should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people theyre seldom withheld by a mediute want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if im tempted for how long might you continue that there would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself this first object when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in short i will do my best perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming years so often and at least you should not remind your mothers bike as i did the other day said elizabeth with the conscious smile there i true it will be wiser me to refrain from her but do not imagine that he has always year so often its on your account that hes been so frequently invited this week you know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends but really and a plund light on her i will try to do what i think to be the widest and now i hope youll satisfy her her aunt assured that she wants and elizabeth has a thank you for the promise its quite a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented mr colin im going to return to her for giving it to you soon after it has been put in front of her ive been jane but as he took up his above with the lukuses his arrival was no great in convenience to miss a venom his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think in inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illneeded term that she wished they might be happy thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday ms lukus paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room as they went downstairs together charlotte said i should have depend upon hearing from you very often eliza that you certainly shall and i have another favorite to ask you will you come see me we shall often meet i hope in herit for sure im not likely to leave camp for some time pruns me there for to come to huntsville elizabeth could not refuse the she force a little pleasure in the visit my father and maria are coming to me in march adding charlotte and i hope you will consent to be the party indeed eliza you will be as welcome to either of them the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and everybody had as much to say work to hear on the subject as usual eliza beth soon heard from her friend and the correspondence was as regular in frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible eliza beth could never address her without feeling that all the conflict of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondence it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was charlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when these letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen she wrote cheerfully seems to reality with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise the house furniture neighbour wooden clothes all to her taste and lady catherines behavior with most friendly and blodging he was mr collins which her husband was and was rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleas her impatience for the second letter was as well rewarded as in patients generally is jane had been a weak in town though either seeing or hearing in caroline she accounted for it however by supposing her last letter to her friend from longborn had by some accident the most my aunt she continued is going to montenetra without part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grover in her street she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen ms bingleas i did not think caroline in spirits she was very glad to see her i was right there for my last letter had never reached her i inquired after their brother of course he was well but so much engaged with mr darcy that those scarcely ever saw him i found that ms darcy was expected to dinner i wish i could see her my visit was not long as caroline and mrs harris were going out a dad say i shall see him soon here i was a bit shook her head over this letter it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr bingleas her sisters being in town four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him she endeavored to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to ms bingleas in attention after whiny at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visit did it last appear the shortness of her state and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt my dear lizzy real and shory being capable of triumphant in her better judgment at my expense when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in this bingleas regard for me but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behavior was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but at the same circumstances were to happen again im sure i should be deceived again caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the meantime when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not only word of wishing to see me again and wasnt every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer i pity that i cannot help blaming her she was very wrong and singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side but i pity her because she must feel that shes been acting wrong and because im very sure that anxiety for her brother is the positive i need not explain myself farther and though we notice anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels that it will easily account for her behavior to me and so deservedly dear is he to his sister whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable i cannot but wonder her ever and her having any such peers now because if you have a terrible thought of me we must have met long ago he knows of my being in tail and im certain from something she said herself and yet it would soon be her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he really is partial to miss darcy i cannot understand it if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that theres a strong appearance of duplicity in all this but i will endeavor to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt let me hear from you very soon miss bingley said something of his never returning to another field again of giving up the house but not with any certainty wed better not mention it im extremely glad that you had such a pleasant account for my friends at hunsford craig oncee then with stabilia and maria im sure youll be very comfortable there yours et cetera this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least all expectation from the brother has now absolutely over she would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcys sister as by wiggums account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away mrs gardner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself he was the admirer of someone else elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write a bit without material pain her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with her leaving that she would have been his only choice for fortune committed it the sudden acquisition of 10000 pounds was the most remarkable charm of the unrelated to him who was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in his case than insurelets did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to remanquish her she was ready to allow it a while in desirable manner for both and could very sincerely wish him happy all this was acknowledged to mrs gardner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on i now convinced my dear aunt that ive never been much in love for how i really experienced that pure and coediting passion i should present to test his very name and wish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordial towards him theyre even impartial towards ms king i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i mean the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl there can be no murder notice my watch for mrs gardners future and there was certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances where i distractedly and loved with him i cannot say that i

rachel and almost promised to answer her letter the farewell between herself and mr rick and mr rick and mr rick is perfectly friendly on his side even more his present pursuit could not make him

enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de boe interesting her opinion of her their opinion of everybody would always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she

his presentation in night quick and his civilities were worn out like his information it was a journey of only time to come by and they began it so early as to be in bass trips like i knew as they drove to mr gardiners door jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see a helpful motherly ever on the stairs were a trip of little boys and whose eagerness for their cousins appearance was not allowed to wait in the drawing room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for 12 months prevented their coming lower always joying in the morning the day passed most bread and bread and bread from morning and baffle and shopping and the evening at one of the theaters elizabeth then came to have to sit by her aunt their first object was her sister and she was more grief than astonished to hear in reply to her friend and replied to him that other jane always struggled to support her spirits they were periods of rejection it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long mrs gardiner gave her the particular also of ms bingleys visit in grace church street and repeated conversations occurred at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance mrs gardiner gained malign her niece and looked at his decision and complimented her and bearing it so well but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is in this king i should be sorry to think her friend mercer nary pray my dear aunt what is the difference in macaroni allophars between the mercer nary and the prudent motive where does discretion end and avarus begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because hes trying to get a girl with only 10000 pounds you want to find out that hes more of sennay if you own a girl thats what a promise came in is i shall know what to think shes a very good kind of girl i believe i know no harm if her but he paid her not the smallest attention to her grandfathers death made her mistress of this fortune now what should he if it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl who he did not care about and he was equally poor there seems an indelicacy in directing his attention towards her so soon after this event a man in distress circumstances does not have time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe if she does not object to have washing me well her not objecting does not justify him it only shows her being deficient in something herself sets her feeling well cried elizabeth how did she choose he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish no muzzi thats what i do not choose i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man whos lived so long in derby shirt oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young man who live in derby shirt and their internet friends who live in her picture are not much better in sick of the mom beg heaven im going to mara where i shall find a man who has not won a grieble quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him stupid man are the only one who cant live in her picture i want to make a movie that speech is the best strongly

taking in the summer we have not determined how far it shall carry out since his gardener but perhaps to the legs no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful oh my dear dear aunt she raptured sweetheart what delight what the lucidie he gave me fresh life and vigor would you to disappoint minnes transport we shall

elizabeth and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight when we left the high road for the main happens hurt every climb was in search of the persons culture and everything dream expected to bring it in the end the palings of rosings park was their boundary on one side elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants at length the personage was terrible the garden sloping to the wall the house standing in the green pales and the laurel hedge everything declared they were arriving mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel block to the house it missed the knots and smiles of the whole time in a moment they walked down the chase and rejoicing at the sight of each other mrs collins welcomed her friend with a lilyous pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found her sense so affectionately received she saw instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage elizabeth just wasnt happy and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the carland he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him but though everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any style of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful and air with such a companion when mr collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not and seldom she voluntarily turned her eye to charlotte once her twice shot could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear after she was long enough to her and they are the furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which she attended himself to work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the health for the stuff he has for science and only to show courage to his face possible here leading the way through every walk and cross the road and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind he could number the fields in the redirection and could tell how many trees are in the most distant clump but of all the views which his garden or which the country or kingdom could boast none would have be compared with the past of those of the four to five old new and few of the four of the park nearly opposite the front of his house it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground from his garden mr collins would have let them round his two metals but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william and cuckoo charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well please probably to have you opportunity to show without her husbands help it was rather small but well built and convenient and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit when mr collins could be forgotten there was really an air of great comfort throughout and by charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten she had already learned that lady catherine was still in the country but the spoken of a grandmother or at dinner in the district room and upstairs yes mrs elizabeth you will have the opportunity to see lady catherine deferred on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i dont not but you will be honored with some portion of her notice when service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister mariah in every invitation with which she honors us during your stay here her behavior to my dear charlotte is charming we dinet roses twice every week and are never allowed to walk home her lady ships carriage is regularly ordered for us i should stay one of her little ships characters for she has several lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbor very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of woman who one cannot regard with too much thank you lady the spaceship we will take you over her for sure news and telling again what had already been written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlottes decree of contentment to understand her addressing inciting and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employment the vexacious interruptions of mr collins and the clearance of their duty as a witness a lie to the magazine soon settled in about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready a set of news for her escape all housing confusion and after listening a moment she heard her she opened the door and met mariah in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the diner and pray there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is we are facing the poor girl of this room elizabeth asked questions in vain mariah would tell you nothing more and down they ran into the dining room which front of the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a lowfaitan at the garden fate is this all cry elizabeth i expected at least that the pigs were gone into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter la my dear and mariah quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them the other is mr gorg only look at her she is quite a little creature who would have thought that she could be so small she is a bombin of the room to keep charlotte out of doors and all this wind why does she not come in oh charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favors when mr bird comes in i like her appearance that elizabeth strapped with other ideas she looks sickly and crost she may do for him very well she will make him a very proper wife mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high diversion was stationed in the doorway in the center of the greatness before and constantly bowing whenever mr bird looked that way at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned to the house mr collins knew soon or saw the two girls and they knew to get to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to die at rosings the next day and the chapter 20 day chapter 29 mr collinss career in consequence of this invitation was to help the power of displaying the grandeur of the speaker was to the one thing visitors and at length theres a village theres himself and his wife was exactly what he had before and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon mr collinss opinion says of lady kevins point of fashion if he knew not how to admire it enough i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her lady ships asking us on sunday to drill tea and spending the evening at rosings i rather expected from my knowledge of the african lady that it would happen but who could have seen such an attention as this who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dying there an invitation more over including the whole party so immediately after you arrive i am the less surprised that when it happened to reply sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which means the situation you like is a weapon to hide about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon scaresly anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but theyre visit to rosings mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rules so many servants and so splendid a dare might not wholly overpower them when the ladies were separating for the toilet he said to elizabeth do not make yourself a new thing because in a butcher apparel lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dressing us which becomes herself and her daughter i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes to superior to the rest there is no occasion for anything more lady catherine will not think the worst of you for being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recognize their room for as they become fairly legit to be waiting for her dinner such formidable accounts of her lady ship and her manner of living quite frightened mariah lutus who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at saint james as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk over the path from while across the park every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir louis diber when he ascended the steps of the hall mariahs alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm elizabeths courage did not fail her she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke of her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of one of her rank shall be sent with us without trevidation from the entrance to all of which mr collins pointed out with a rat on his air the fine proportion and the finished ornaments they followed the servants through an empty chamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs jameson were sitting her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary in spite of having been at st jamess sir william was so complete with like a grander or so handy that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take the seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened to almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to learn elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her compulsively lady catherine was a tall large woman with strongly marked features which might work certain handsome her air was not consolidated nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative at home as marked herself for importance and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he represented when after examining the mother in whose countenance and department she soon found some of the answers she could almost have gone to mariahs astonishment at her being so thin and so small there was neither any big or large face and glass between the ladies mr wickham was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke a very little except in a low voice two mrs jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in a perfect direction before the eyes after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her lady ships desire and looked to see felt that life could furnish nothing greater he carved an a in craze to light his lacquerity and every dish was commented first by him and then by sir william so is now enough recovered to echo whatever his soninlaw said in a manner which elusive with wonder to lady catherine could bear but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious words especially when any of them were treated to them the party did not supply much conversation the elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and mr bird the form of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the letters did not agree to her mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little mr bird ate pressing her to try some of her dishes and fearing she was in disposed mariah thought speaking out of the question and the gentleman did nothing but eat and admire when the ladies returned to the drawing room there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission to coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to having her judgment contradicted she inquired into charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small and honest hers and instructed her as to the care of the cows and her poetry the elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others in the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins she addressed the variety of questions to mariah and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connection she knew the least and who she observed to mrs collins was a very gentle pretty sort of girl she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what parents were fathered and what had been her mothers met name elizabeth felt all the inclusions of her father but answered in very simple manner lady catherine then absurd your fathers estate is entailed to mr collins but he feels sick and im in the blood of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing his states from the female line it was not thought necessary in sir louis deburgs family do you play in sing miss bennett a little oh then sometime or other we shall be happy to hear you our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it someday do your sisters play in sing one of them does why did you not all learn you ought all talent when this words often and the title is not so good and income is yours dont draw no not at all what none of you not one that is very strange but i suppose you had no opportunity your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of mastery my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london has your governess left you no governance how was that possible five daughters brought up at home without a governance i have never heard of such a thing your mother must have been quite a slave to your education elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that she had not been the case then who taught you who attended to you without a government you must have been elected compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wish to learn never wanted the means we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be idols certainly might i know doubt but that is what a governance and if i had no room under i would have advised her most strongly or slightly to engage one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governments can give it it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way i am always glad to get a young person well placed up four nieces of mrs jenkinsons are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her mrs collins did i tell you of lady metcalfs calling yesterday to thank me she finds ms pope petrecher lady katherine she said you have given me a treasure are any of your younger sisters out ms benin yes maam oh all what all five out at once very odd and you only the second the younger ones out before the elder ones are married your younger sisters must be very young yes my youngest is not 16 perhaps she is a full young to be much in company but really maam i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters but they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have a means or inclination to marry early the last born has a spirit right to the pressures of youth parents the first and do we have to back on such a motor i think it would not be very nice upon my words that her lady ship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person pray what is your age with three younger sisters grown up the elder has a dogs mind your lady ship can hardly expect her to own it lady katherine seemed quite astonished and not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinent you cannot be more than 20 i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age i am not one in 20 when the gentleman had joined them and he was over the the car tables were placed lady katherine sir william and mr mrs collins sat down to quadril and mrs sipdiver chose to play at casino the two girls had the honor of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her party their table was super litillish stupid scarsely as syllable with uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of mr birds being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light a great deal more past at the other table lady katherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote to herself mr collins was employed in a green to everything her lady should said thanking her for every fishy one and a poetry i think you thought he won too many mr william did not say much he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names when lady katherine was also played as long as they chose the tables were broken up the carriage was offered to mrs collins greatfully accepted and immediately ordered the party then gathered around the fire to hear lady katherine determine what weather they were to have on the moral from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches that thank mrs collins to side and as many bowels on sir williams they departed as soon as they driven from the door elizabeth was called and by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlottes sake she made more favorable than it really was but her commentation so costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her lady ships praise into his own hands end of chapter 29 this is a liberal box recording all liberal box recordings are in the public domain for more information which a volunteer visit librivoxorg pride and prejudice by jane austen chapter 30 sir williams stayed only a week at huntsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbor as were not often met with last sir williams was with them mr collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual influence and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of a cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner it was now passed by him on the way work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of the window in his own bookroom which french had the road the room in which the lady sat was out there elizabeth at first rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the diningprior for common use it was a better sized room and had a more pleasant aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arranged from the drawing really could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indented to mr collins for the knowledge of what herde is going to long and how often especially mr ward which would never fail for the two of them the winner every day she not unfrequently stopped at the personage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise to elizabeth recollected that there might be other family the things to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours now and then they were honored with the call from her leadership and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits she examined into their employment looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemate in negligence and if she accepted any refreshments the scene would do it only for the sake of finding out that this is collins fault hmm i mean its soon perceived that the discreet lady was not in commission of the piece of the county she was the most active member straight in her entire life the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontentative or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first their other engagements were famous as the style of living in the neighborhood in general would be on mr collinss reach this however was no evil to live as a bit and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and then whether it was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors her favorite one in which she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was a lonely open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt behind the reach of lady catherines curiosity in this quiet room the first fortnight of her visit seemed passed away easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring in addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintances who she did not prefer his coming wood furnished one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless ms bingleys designs on him were by his behavior to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked to his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been—he was a little more nervous than mr collins was walking the whole morning with in view of the lodges opening into his bedlaying in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park her heat home with the great intelligence on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his lord and to the great surprise of all the party when mr collins returned the gentleman accompanied him shire that had seen them from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honor they might expect adding i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the lord el and shortly afterwards took the regentalment entry to the room colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about 30 not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in her picture payed his compliments with the usual reserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure elizabeth would recruit to two women whod have seen her colonel fitzwilliam entered into the conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a wellbred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house in garden to mrs collins so at present i am not speaking to anybody at length however his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of elizabeth after the help of the family she answered him in the usual way and after a moments pause added my old sister has been in town these three months have you never happened to see her there she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would be triany consciousness of what had passed between the bingles and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that hed never been so fortunate as to meet mrs bennett the subject was pursued no farther and the gentleman soon afterwards went to
