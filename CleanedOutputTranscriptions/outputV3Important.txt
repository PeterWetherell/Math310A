haunted house amuse the heart of romantic felicity without the asking too much of fate still i am proudly declared that there is something poor about it but what else should it be left so cheaply and why are the stints so untimidated john raskin will be pleased but one expects that of the new issue john is practical and extreme he has no patience with fate and since then he has no choice but to be felt and seen and put down in figures john is a physician and perhaps i would say would be so opposed to this is a bad paper and a great relief to my mind perhaps that is one reason i do not get well faster you see he does not believe i am sick and what can one do that the physician christ stoner and his own husband who shows things and relatives that there is really nothing to matter with you but sincerely know this depression a slight hysteria tendency what is one to do a brother is also a physician and also a physician and he says the same thing so i take both states of both sides whichever it is and times and journeys and air and exercise and absolutely just a bit of it and so i will go on again personally i disagree with their ideas personally i believe in genuine excitement and change they do me good with what is one to do i give that from my own experience but it does its absolute good deal having to be so sly about it or its neat with heavy opposition i sometimes spend some of my tuition if i have less than a position in the society than stimulus but john says the very worst thing i can do is think about my tuition and i confess that all this makes me feel wrong so i will look it alone and talk about the house the newest beautiful place that is quite alone standing well back in the road quite three miles from the village it makes me think of english places which you read about but there are fetters and warriors and dates that lack and lots of separate little fizzes for the gardeners and people there is a delicious garden i never saw such a garden large and shady with a boxed knitted pass and lined with many bricktobrick antlers and scents on it there were green houses too theyre all broken now there was some legal trouble about it something about the village i heard about in this family a place that has been empty for years that spores my gursiness im afraid but i dont care theres something strange about that i cant feel it i even saw something john when we met he said what i felt was a drop in the sheltering room i get unreasonable angry with john sometimes im sure i never used to be so sensitive i think it is due to this nervous condition but john says by fear so forcefully brought up yourself and so so i take pains to control myself before him at most and that makes me very tired i dont like our room but a rented room downstairs and a room in the middle of the house and had ways all over the room in such pretty oldfashioned chintz paintings with john and dr herberts he said there was only one woman and not one for two days and no new room for him if he took another hes very careful and loving and hardly lets me stare at a special direction i have a severe prescription for each eye on the door he takes all care of me and so i feel very safe and grateful not too valuable for me he said he came here so young and i was to have perfect rest and all the air i could get your exercise depends on your strength my dear said me and your feelings somewhat on your appetite that air you can absorb all the time so you take the nurse at the top of your eyes it is a big air in the room the whole floor in there with windows in it all the way and air in sunshine all over the room it is a massive space and in prayer it means amazing in such a way the windows are balanced and little chivalry and there are leaves in the room the paint and paper which is a little gray is a little bit of a mystery it is stripped off and there are great patches all around the head and the back about the stars that can meet and in a great place on the other side of the room and no doubt i never saw worse paper in my life than those strong grandbuilding patterns committing everyones existence it is a very natural and easyonthephone to notice the lack of trust in your irritable of your study and when you follow the room in certain periods in a little distance the sun can see us up and the rain can see us and the sun can hear us the trouble is oh i need to go im going to go and im going to go i still need to go and im going to go im going to go and im going to go im going to go and im going to go im going to go no wonder the children paid it i should pay it myself if i had to live in this room why there comes time when i take this item it takes me to have a writer in the room weve been here two weeks and we havent felt that writing for since that first day im sitting by the room up in this atrocious nursery where there is nothing to hinder my writings and nothing that could be me to sing the rap of a student john is away all day and even some nights in his cases of seers im glad my case is not serious but these nervous people have sped rightfully depressed me john does not know how much i really suffer he knows there is no reason to suffer and ive satisfied myself i pour for this only nervousness it does bear any sorrow right anywhere i need to be such a head to john such a real west and company and here i am in parochet wording ready no one would believe that an apple grows to do what little one would ever do to dress and entertain and other things that his fortunate marry a sobidwilled baby such a dear baby and yet i cannot dear woman make me so nervous i suppose john does never know this in his own he laughs at me so about this wallpaper at first he meant to repaper the wall but afterwards he said i was letting it rip the bed with him and that nothing in his ears can know this patient than to give way to such fences he said that after the wallpaper is changed itll be the heavy bed still and in the barred windows and in the dirt ahead of the stairs and so on and you know the place is doing a good this man and really dear i dont care to renovate a house just for a threemonths winter and do let us go downstairs i said there are such pretty rooms there then he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little piece and said he would go down to the cellar and have a white wash and he was like a man with the beds and the noodles and things it is an airy and comfortable room and theres no room for me in the kitchen and it would not be so silly for me to make him uncomfortable just for a while im really getting quite hungry dear woman ill be right back with a paper thats when i knew i could see the groundwork theres mysterious deepsheeted ovaries with young ebony and spadeuppushing clouds and bushes and marines and trees see the moon do you know what youre doing do you know what youre doing going into the stairs there is a beautiful shaded ring that lays down on there for my house my only expense is to keep my familys newest parents and owners but johns mission will not be to be with the entity in the house he says that with my imaginative power and habit of storyworking i know this weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited penises and that i ought to use my real and good sense to check the tendency so i try i think sometimes when we go to likewe they relieve the press of ideas and rest them but i find i get pretty tired from my child hes so discouraging i want to have any advice and companionship about my work when i get really well john says i wasnt hitting a jew around for a long visit he says he would as soon as put fireworks in my pilgrims i say let me have those stimulating people without me knowing i wish i could have been asked that but i must not think about that this paper makes to me as if it knew that i wish its been for me and so forth theres a burnt spot on the cutting nails that have broken out and two beddys of storytelling is not there i get positively angry with the importance of it and the everlasting is up and down sideways they come and as its seen im a little worried about every one theres neither grace nor too blessed that im not sure and the eyes are only open now and now and im a little happy when i know i like to see so much expression in my dreams and we all know how much expression lies and the strength of its charm and the energy of pain and its terror and the need for weapons and its main potential and the most children to find and to use them i remember that i finally read the minds of our big old viewers to have and there was one share that i only seen as a small friend i used to feel that if any of the other things looked too foolish i could always shut things up so that they wouldnt be seen the furniture in this room is no worse than anything in this room but we have to be at all that can be done in this area i suppose when this room is in a hurry we have to take the nursery from this house and no wonder i never saw such a lot of these little childrens are made here the wall of the house is torn apart in a stick of tissue on the wall and must have had a fish of variance in the rice paper then the floor is stretched and walls are stretched out its faster itself than the wrap youre wearing and its a great pity to go with a tiny tiny wall this is a little bit of a real struggle but i dont know if thats how you feel where it comes from the sister such a dear girl she is shes so careful in this not only one in one room shes a good and easiest to cast in and helps a new better profession i very believe she thinks it is the right one which made me see it but i do not which is all i want to see her learn when im on the list theres one that can be easily learned i love how shes a good girl and then it just looks like a little person i love her passion too but with great parents and other parents this one i think it has a kind of somehow different shape but particularly irritating and i think we see it in certain ways in that poor girl and this is her isnt fair and when the sun is just set it seems to me it seems to me it seems to me it seems to spoke about her in the city and it was picked up in the city theres sister on the stairs well the 4th of july is over the people are gone and im in town i missed john thought it might be needed to see her again so he just had another one and it showed him down for me of course i didnt do it then genius instead of coming out but it tied me in the same john says i dont think im a suspicious you can run and meet her in town but i dont know how to go home i had a friend who was in this house and she says he was just like john in my brother only more so besides it is such an unbecoming thing to see her home dont feel as if it was worthwhile to turn my hand in everything anything when getting rid of her and threatening her in this i found her beautiful i found her nice and tall of course i dont know john this year or anybody else i found her in a new room i found her in a room good deal just now johns kept in town very after my serious cases and genius did and its been a long long time so i walked a little in a bar and down at wobby lone sit on the porch under the roof and lie down in a chair for a while i never get a hold of any suspicious people i was a little bit cold it dwells in my mind so i lie here in this great and meagre bed it is near and round i tell you that im not quite a good person it is as good as gymnastics when i see you i start personally at the bottom down in the corner of the bed where there has not been a test and i determine for the thousandth time that i will follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a conclusion i know a little of the principle of design and i know this thing is not arranged on any lens of radiation or alternation or repetition or symmetry or anything else that i remember here it is i get repeated with this by the breads but not otherwise meet that in one way each bread stands alone the bladed drawers and fourishes are kind of debased brominesque with delirium trimmings where wobbling up and down in isolated columns of fertility but on the other hand they can make diagonals and the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting ways up to car like a lot of wobbling sea waves and soil chase the whole thing goes horizontally too at least it seems so i exhaust myself in trying to distinguish the point of this doing in the production there is a horizontal breadth on the fumes and that adds one difference to the confusion there is one end of the ring where it is almost intact and there in the postlife state an elation shines directly with paint i can almost fancy the elation at that the intonable tests seem to form around the cutting center and mush off in a paintmolded fumes of equal destruction it makes me tired of feathers i will take a nap i guess i dont know why i should write this i dont want to i dont feel able and i know john that i feel that i must say that i feel that i think in some way that there is such a relief but the effort is getting to be greater than a relief half the time i am often relieved and lie down ever so much john says i miss him easily and he has me take a little more and lots of tunics and things to say nothing in a long rare heat dear john he loves me dear and hates to have me sick i try to have a real earnest reason to talk with him dear john and tell him this is the issue that we go and make a visit to cousin pinnum and jill but he said i wasnt able to go nor able to stand it after i got there and i did not make out a very good case with myself while i was crying before i finished it is getting to be a great effort to meet the bank states this is nervous work my sense of the release and dear john gathered me up in his arms and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed i sat by him and liked him until the time he said i was his dog his comfort and all he had and that i must take care of myself for his sake and keep well he says no one but myself can help me out of it but i must use my will and selfcontrol and not let any silly answers unwaver me there is one comfort the baby is well and happy and there is no way i could occupy this notion of a horrible outfit if we had not used it the blessed child would have what a fortunate escape why i wouldnt have a child of mine an impressionable little thing living such a wonderful world i never thought of it before but it is nothing that john had taken here after all i can stand so much easier than baby you see up to a sign i never mentioned to me in two hours but i keep watching it all the same there are things in that paper that nobody knows in another world and i know that outside of that i dont do the shape but we do every day as far as the same shape and were doing means and it is like a woman stepping down and creeping about behind that pattern i dont like the kids and i wonder what they mean to me i wish john would take me away from here it is so hard to talk with john about my face because he was so wise and because he loves me so but i tried it last night it was moon nights the moon shines in all around just as the sun does i hate to see it sometimes but i think its so slow it turns out so much better john is a seeker but ive hated to wait for him so i kept stealing and watching him and i couldnt relate to what i had to do until i fucked people the fate figured behind it seemed to shake the pattern just as if she wanted to get out i got up soft and went to feel and i got up slow and went to feel and i see if the people didnt and then i came back john was away what is it little girl he said dont go walking about like that you get cold i thought i was a good time to talk so i told him that i really was not gaming here and that i wished he would take me away my darling said he at least would be up in three weeks and i cant see how to leave before or pairs are not done at home and i cannot possibly leave town just now of course if you are in any danger i could and would but you really are better dear whether you can see it or not i am a doctor dear and i know you are gaining flesh and color your appetite is better i thought really much easier about you i dont wear bits more said i know as much and my appetite may be better in the evening when you are here but it is worse in the morning when you are away the last holy little heart said he with a great big plug she shall be as sick as she pleases but now lets improve the shining hours by going to sleep and talk about it in the morning and you wont go away i asked you why how can i dear but it is only three weeks more i mean you will take a nice little trip of a few days while jimmy is getting the house ready really dear you are better better in body perhaps i began to stop shorts for he sat up straight and mutated me with such a stern reproach for me but i could not say another word my darling snippy my baby view will my fake in full arch house fake as well as for your own which you will never for one instant let that idea into your mind there is nothing so dangerous so fascinating to a temperament like yours it is a false and foolish fantasy can you not trust me as a position you might tell you so so of course i said no more on that scar and we went to sleep for a long he thought i would sleep first but i wasnt and lay there for hours trying to decide whether that front pattern and that back pattern really did move together or suffered me on a pattern like this by daylight there is a lack of sequence a defiance of law there is a constant irritant to a normal mind the color is hideous enough and unreliable enough and infuriating enough that the pattern is torturing you think you are mastered but just as soon as you get well underway in phone it turns up that somersault and there you are it slaps you in the face knocks you down and troubles the pain this is like a bad dream the outside pattern is a flawed arabesque reminding one of the fullness if you can imagine a taste of you in joints and in turn there is a stream of taste stewers bedding and sprouting and endless convolutions why that is something like it that is sometimes there is one market peculiarity about this paper i think nobody seems to know this by myself and that is that it changes as the light changes when the sun shoots in through the east window the sun is shining and the sun is shining when the sun shoots in through the east window i always watch that first long straight mirror it changes so quickly that i never can quite believe it that is why i watch it always by moonlight the moon shines in all night when there is moonlight i wouldnt know it is the same paper at night in any kind of light in twilight candlelight lamplight and most of all of our moonlight it becomes bores the outside pattern i mean and the woman that find it is as plain as can be i didnt realize for a long time that the thing was that showed behind that dim subpane but now i am quite sure it is a moon by daylight she is subdued quite i fancy that it is the pattern that suits her so still she is so pleasant that she is meek by it by the hour i lie down ever so much john says it is nipping me and to sleep all i can indeed he started a habit on looking me lie down for an hour to each me there is a very bad habit i am convinced that you see i dont sleep and that cultivates the sleep but i dont tell them i am awake oh no the fact is indeed i really feel it he seems very innocent and even jean hasnt been particularly he strikes me in the face and just in the scientific hypothesis the perfect act of it is the paper i have watched john and he did not realize it being put into the moons hotness in this innocent species left hot in several times and making act the paper and 22 attacked jean with a hand on it once she didnt know what to do and then i asked her in the cracks but she was very quiet but the most australian man in the person what she was doing with the paper she turned around and said she had been cutstealing and looked better than that asking her why she was fighting herself then she said that the paper stained everything it touched and she found millions of inches on all my toys and drawings and she whispered me in my traffic did not that sound innocent but i know she was studying it kind of and i am determined that nobody should find out that my phone white is so very much more exciting than it used to be we should have a silky northed step to look forward to it to watch i will do it better and i am more quiet than i was john is so pleased to see me in three do not believe me the other day instead i see me portioned as part of my wallpaper i turned it off i had no intentions on him it was because of the wallpaper he would make fun of me he might even want to take me away i dont want to leave him until i find out there is a week more and i think that would be enough i am feeling either so much better i dont sleep much at night but he is so interesting once he develops but i see the good deal in the daytime in the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing there are always new shits on the phone and new shades of yellow all over the place that do not change the way i try to transition it is the strangest yellow that wallpaper it makes me think of all the yellow things i ever saw not beautiful ones that are better times but they are of bad bad and old things if there is something else about that paper the smell i noticed that the minute we came into the room there was so much air and sun and it was not bad now we have had a week of barge and moon and whether the windows are open or not the smell is still here it creeps all over the house i find it heavy when i am done with it spiky when i am caught hiding in the hand and i am waiting on the stairs but it is me and my kid even when i go to ride if i turn my head suddenly and surprise it there is that smell it is such a peculiar thing to do i have spent hours in silence the sign hit smell it is not bad at first and very gentle but quite the subtlest most enduring i have ever met and as damp weather it is awful i wake up in the night and find it hanging over me it used to disturb me at first i thought seriously burning the house to reach the smell but now i am useless the only thing i can think of is that it is like the pillow of the paper a yelling smell there is a very funny mark on this banner to go down with the mark there a street runs around the room it goes before every piece of furniture except the bed and long streets even slouch as if it had been walked over and through there i never had this done who did it and what they did it for round and round and round round and round and round it makes me dizzy i really had discovered something at last the orchards image in my mind when it changes some i have finally found it out the foot pattern does move and i wonder the woman behind shapes it sometimes i think there are great many women behind but sometimes only one and she comes around fast and her phone shakes it all over then in the very bright spots she comes in still and in the very shady spots she just breaks the door and breaks them hard and she is all the time trying to try and do but nobody could try and do that pattern explain it so i think that is when it has so many heads they get through and in the pattern strongly is the mark and turns them upside down and makes their eyes bright those heads are covered and taken off and thats the mark i think that woman gets out in the daytime and i tell you what i see her i can see her out of every one of the windows it is the same woman i know where she is always creeping and this woman do not think about their lives i see her on that long road out of the trees and then she comes in for a walk and on that carriage pass she hides under the white barbed wire i dont blame her if its it must be very humiliating to be kept creeping by day i always locked the door and i keep knocking at night and do it at night and my job is suspecting me of any works and john is so prayerful that i dont want to irritate him and wish he would take another woman besides anybody to get that woman out at night but me soon i hope to remember if i could see her out of every window as it once but trying as fast as i can i can only see out of the night at the time and though i always see her she may be able to fit faster than i can try ive watched her sometimes away from the open country creeping as fast as a cloud shudder in a high wind but only that tap pattern could be gotten around from the end of her i mean to try it little by little ive found out another funny thing that i shall tell you this time it is not really a trustee to be honest there are only two more days to pick this paper up and i believe john is beginning to notice i dont like to look in his eyes and ive heard him ask jim a lot of professional questions about her she had a very good report to give she said i slept a good deal in the daytime john knows i dont sleep very well at night i only want to soak in it he asked me all sorts of questions too and took the phone out to be very lovely when i turn on it as if i couldnt see through him still i dont wonder he acts so sleeping under this paper for three nights i dont know if hes sleeping under this paper for three nights but im interested but i feel sure john and jim will see the effect of this hello this is the last day but it is enough john is to stay in town over nights and hell be out until this evening jim you wanted to sleep with me this afternoon and i told her i should undoubtedly risk better for a night all alone that was clever but i really wasnt alone in a bit as far as it was moonlight and that poor thing began to crawl and shape the pattern i got up and ran to her for it i told her she was short i should think she pulled and the full morning we appeared over the yards of the paper i stood about as far as my head and half around the room and then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me i declared i would finish it today wed go away tomorrow and there only we all my furniture down again to leave things as they were and jimie looked at the wall in amazons but i told her narrowly that i did it of a pure spite of the vicious thing she laughed and said she wouldnt mind doing it herself but i must not get tired as she was totally soaked but i am here and no person touches this paper but me not alone she tried to get me out of the room it was too apparent but i said it was so quiet and empty and it seemed now that i believed i would lie down again and sleep all night through i went to work and we were even for dinner and it all happened real so now she is down and the servants are down and the things are down and there is nothing left i took a bedstead and nailed down and returned this mattress and found it i used to sleep downstairs too much and take a bedspread and turn it i thought i enjoyed it a little but i was scared i had always killed and did terrible out here this bedstead is very long i was like i was like i was like i dont want to go out i dont want to have anybody come in i was stunned i dare you to look at me but you didnt if that woman does get out and tries to get away it can save her but i forgot i could not reach far without anything to stand on this bed we not moved i tried to lift and push it until i was laying and then i got so angry i bit off a little piece at one corner and hurt her too they are pure black all the paper i could reach standing on the floor it sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it all these strangled heads and bald eyes and wobbly pungous grace just fight with duration im getting angry enough to do something different to jump out the window would be admirable exercise but the bars are too strong and hard to find besides i wouldnt do it of course not but that is the important thing i might be mismissed i dont like to even look out of the windows there are so many of those creeping women and they keep seeing heads i would have thought i would come out of that window but i am securely passing down by my well hidden road and dont get kneeappend right there and suppose i should have this happen the pattern may have come nice and that is poor it is so pleasant to be out in this great wing and creep around like this i didnt want to feel sorry i didnt even have jim ask me to outside you have to creep on the ground and everything is green instead of yellow but here i can feel smooth and unpure and my shoulder just sticks in that wrong stench around my wall so i cannot lose my way why is there a giant at the door its no use young man you cant open it i just dont have time to open it i was crying for the ass it would be a shame to break down that beautiful door fine dear said i in a generous voice that she is down by the front steps and you are playing with me there is science telling her if i am missing what do you feel i can open the door i cant see the key is down by the front door and there are crying things and then i said it again several times very gently said he said it so often and had to go in the sea and he got it of course and came in he snuck in what is the matter if you try the gods sake what are you doing i kept on creeping just the same but i lifted him over my shoulder i have dried out of your last said i in spite of you and zinny and i pulled off most of the paper so you cant put me back now why should the man have fainted what he did and waited for us my path by the wall so that i had to creep over him every time i was a little bit scared i was a little bit scared i was scared i was scared and took the open room and done we werent like that i shared pickings doing reported by i�� vielen from was there i learn october two two thousand rests
