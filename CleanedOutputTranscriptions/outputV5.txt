 this is a readable recording i read the watch recording on the internet the more information that you want to hear is visited wwwdaptorealcom i love you i love you let me tell you that you must be this such a true leadership and definitely a very valuable my charlotte puppies girl it is very seldom in your ordinary people i join myself securing such profiles for the same a colonial mansion a hereditary estate i would say a haunted house and rich the fight of romantic philosophy but that would be asking too much of fate still i would proudly declare that there is something pure about it but why else could it be less so cheaply and why that stays a long untimely john laughs at me in the face but no one expects that in my area john is practical to me extreme he has no patience to think and in fit thought he is a possible not to be thought and seen and put down in figures john is a tradition and perhaps i dont know if im living so well but this is a great fit and a great relief to my mind perhaps that is one reason i do not live so well in that state you see he does not believe i am fit and what commanding but that the fit man cant stand and knows only heaven that there is thin and military that there is really nothing to matter with me but thinking of him in nervous depression or slightly scared of intimacy and what is wrong to me my brother is also a proficient man and also a kind man and he is also a good man so i take both faiths and false thoughts whichever it is and tonics and journeys and air exercise and absolutely forget them and i take them all again personally i disagree with your ideas personally i believe that if you kneel and if you sit and change you do me good but what is one to do weve got faith in this matter but it dies in selfsufficiency if youre having to be so sly about it or else you meet with heavy opposition i sometimes stand to be in opposition but if i have less opposition in the real society than the stimulus what john says is the very worst thing i can do is think about my position and i confess it always makes me feel bad so i will let it alone and talk about the house the most beautiful place that is quite alone standing well back from the road like three miles from the village it makes me think of english placing on two new roads where there are hedges and walls and gates that lock and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people theres a delicious garden i never saw such a garden large and shady full of boxboarded paths and lined with long great covered arches with silk tannins there are greenhouses too but theyre all broken now there was some legal trouble i could do something about the poverty of food haters finally the place has been empty for years that spoils my merciless i am afraid but i dont care theres something strange about the house i can feel it i mean he said something john i mean he said what i felt was abrupt and sharpblown i get then reasonably angry with john sometimes im sure ive never used to be so sensitive i think it is due to this nervous condition but john said if i feel so i should regret the thought of selfpreciel so i take the urge to be sure of myself before him and that makes me very proud i dont like how you are i want to go downstairs with the people im in contact with and i know its only in the room in such pretty old fashion its hanging but john will not hear it he said there was only one room and not one for two rooms and no new room for him if he took another hes very careful and loving and finally thats me still not special than it can i have a scheduled prescription for each morning though he takes all care of me and so i feel basically ungrateful not to know youre there he said we came here solely on my own if i was to have perfect rest and all the air i could get your exercise depends on your strength my dear said he and your food somewhat on your appetite but you can absorb all the time so we take the measure of the top of our heads you didnt do anything the whole floor the windows of the building and air and sunshine everywhere and the main street the main playground is amazing the windows are marked with the children and there are wings and things in the wall the main thing to take a look at is a good morning school it was spittal but the great catch was the morning when you hit the road now the stars are in the moon and in a great place on the other side of the moon and there was a song of worst people in the world and a little song of grandforbidden events that made him able to exist it was a lonely and easy morning and most of all most of you feel the same and the books tell you and when you fall you may be set in stone and when youre in despair you may be sent to make excuses you dont even know where youve been you spoil yourself and when youre in pain youre falling in love and when youre in pain you may be set in stone and when youre in pain you may be set in stone no you will never be set in stone set in stone no wonder the children are painted this way i should paint it myself if i had to live in this rain alone there comes john i must put this away he hates to have it left weve been here two weeks and i havent felt like writing for him since that first day im sitting in the barbell in the room happiness is precious and merciless and theres nothing to hinder my writing as much as i please said blackstone john is awake all day and even some nights when his cases are serious im glad my case is not serious these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing john does not know how much i really suffer he knows theres no reason to suffer and ive saddened him but the lord says im in nervousness theres a way on this earth not that we might be in any way i need to be such a help to god such a real mess to the public and here i am compared to the lord in all ways no one would believe what he ever did but the little i made dress and entertain and other things it is fortunate an area so good for the baby such a dear baby and yet i cannot speak with him it makes me so nervous i suppose john was never nervous in his life he laughs at me so about this little paper at first he meant to repaper the room but afterwards he said that i was letting it rip the better of me and that nothing was worse for a nervous patient than to give way to such fancies he said that after the wallpaper was changed that it would be the heavy bedstead and then the barred windows and then the dated and the heavy restaure and so on and he knows the place in which im here and i really do i dont care if i renovate and help just for a threemonth sliver then do let us go downstairs i said there are such pretty windows there then he took me in the morning to find me a blessed little room and said he would go down to the ceiling and have a white wash under the bottom but heres whats enough about the bed and when he was in pain it is an air of uncomfortable room and me wanting to use that hand for it i would now be so silly to make him unpumped just for a few minutes im really getting quite the volume while im having a little paper i dont want anyone to know i can see that theres mysterious deepshaded air and i just pour a passion for it i wish thered been more of my dreams i dont want to be a little bit more happy about it i want to write it down belying to the estate there is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house i always fancy i see people walking on these numerous paths and all of them up but down there and up and up and i think ill wear a fancy on the east he says that with my imaginative power and habit of story making like mine is sure to lead to all manners of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency so i try i think sometimes if i were only well enough to write for you you would relieve the press of ideas and lessons but i find i get pretty tired when im trying it is so discouraging not to have any advice and tenorship about my work when i get really well john says we will have pleasant henry and julia down for a long visit but he says you were the soonest bit fireworks in my philippines nice to let me have those stimulating people about my time i wish i could get better first but i must not think about that this paper looks to me as a bit mutable and vicious for me theres a pork spot for ten years at the coconut tree and two of those this time are scared to have something i get positively angry with the importance of it and everlastness up and down the sun rays that fall and theres a seer in the northern of the philippines theres no need to think about the progress of the movement theres no need to think about the movement theres no need to think about the movement theres no need to think about the movement theres no need to think about the movement theres no need to think about the movement theres no need to think about the movement theres no need to think about the movement theres no need to think about the movement theres no need to think about the movement theres no need to think in terms of the movement theres no need to think about the movement theres no need to think about the movement theres a way of the movement theres no need to think about the movement theres a way okay i knew the other thing i thought was true to me i could always talk to him about the children and be certain the furniture in this room is no worse than the ones on the main floor but you have to be all up to your own mistakes i suppose the most convenient of the program is having to take the new suit on his foot and no wonder i never saw something like it in the childrens room here the law thing with us its all up to his thoughts we stick it closer when done they must have had personal learning to the lowest people then the floor is smashed and the ground is slummed the master himself is not doing anything this great hidden bed is a tiny tiny room looks a little bit like a dirty room but i dont mind im sure im a little let those gentlemen sit such a dear girl she is be so careful of her you must not let her come in shes a perfect and easy master possibly and hopes for no better profession im very envious she thinks it was the lighting which made her sit but i do not want her to sit in the room you see her long enough theres one room in the room i love the shady room the room just looks awful and empty i love the comfy room theres great rooms and another room this wall is a perfect room for something im a perfect showroom i particularly hate to know but i want to see it in certain rooms i want to feel it in you many places are easy for you and when the sun is just setting i can see a stage im hoping for a wonderful i can see its just a perfect room i want to see it i can see it theres this long stairs well the 4th of july is over the people are gone and running and turning around going down the mountain maybe is a little bit of a problem theres this house in the middle of the mountain the children are in the middle of the mountain jimmy says to me im going to try and find a place to sit john said im going to sit he said if i sit you can wear a helmet and a helmet but i dont want to be in the middle of the mountain i dont want to be in the middle of the mountain i dont want to be in the middle of the mountain and he says he just left a gun in my brother hes a little small so he says im such an idiot im going to go to the top dont feel as if it was worth it turn my hand over from anything im getting dreadfully hurt for the girls im fine im fine im fine im just fine of course i dont feel honest here or anybody else im going to run i know a really good deal about some of it johns kept in town very often on serious cases and vinnie whos been with me for a long long time wanted to i walked over the rain in the garden im down at the lovely land i sit on the porch out of the rain i lie down and feel a good deal im never going to fall in the rain this time im not going to fall in the rain this time im not going to fall in the rain im not going to fall in the rain it dwells in my mind so my mind is great and movable it is a male band it falls that kind of a thing it is a good man im doing it im doing it its a good man im doing it im starting to listen im starting to go over there for a good amount of time and im determined for the thousand times that i will follow that pointless pattern of some sort of a conclusion i know a little of a principle of design and i know this thing was not arranged on any laws of radiation or alternation or repetition or symmetry or anything else that i might have heard of i do the keeping of the purpose by the purpose but not others i looked at it in one way each breath stands alone the bloody blood of the blood stands alone the blooded curves and fourishes are kind of the base bramonesque with delirium trimmings theyre wobbling up and down in isolated columns of fertility but on the other hand they can make diagonally and the sprawling outline grown off in great slanting waves up the corner like a lot of wobbling sea waves with full shape the whole thing goes through the way it seems to me i exhaust myself in front of this seamlessly filled up distorted imagination there is a horizontal breath for a phase that adds a wonderful confusion theres one in the room where its almost no time and there when it falls like a spade my little time shines directly at the end thats the almost basic radiation thats going on the only big big step is going to fall in the running slumber and rush back to the terminal of telling me that deep blue destruction makes no time for me i will take a nap on this i dont know why i should write this i dont want to i dont feel able i know johnny that im a bit of a sliver i dont know much the sliver that i feel in the slumber could do such a relief but the effort is going to be greater than you need half the time im an awful little and lie down ever so much johnny says i mustnt lose my spirit he has me take a pet of a oil and lots of tonics and things to say nothing ailing young and wither neat dear john i was a new dude and hates to have me sick i tried to have a real earnest reason to talk to him in the end of the day and tell him that i wish hed let me go and make a visit because the thing would be ruined but he said i wasnt able to go no i was able to stand it after i got there and i did not make out a very good case for myself i was crying before i finished it is getting to be a great effort for me to finish this this is never something i should finish and dear john gathers me up in his arms and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed this sat on my head until he tired my head he said i was his dog and his comfort and all he had and that i must take care of myself for this sake and keep well he said to me no one but myself can help me out of it but i must use my will and not make deely silly pens as im waiting theres one topic that the baby is well and happy and doesnt have to occupy this nursery with a very good thing if we had not used it the blessed child would have but a fortune in escape why i wouldnt have a child of mine and fresh little thing live in such a room for worlds i never thought of it before but it is lucky that john could leave me after i had so much easier than waiting in this room but of course i never mentioned what i had to do with this but i keep watching about all this we have things in that paper that nobody knows what ever we own i have helps on credit and do sheep with fear every day always the same sheep only very new ones and it is lucky in the only one sticking down and peaking about the honey of the pattern i dont like the bits i wonder if theyll be the same i wish john would take me away from here it was so hard to talk with john about my case but the case here is so wise and the case he was in was so but i tried to understand it was new york the moon shines all around the city sun and this is the sun i cant see it sometimes but its so little slow and i know theres cameras on my way i dont know if i remember john lives in the city and ive hated to wait for him so i kept stealing and watched him eat when i got down to the lady in the house with john feltman but they figured my kind of scene to shake the pattern just as wish he wanted to get out i got up soft and looked at the field and see if the paper didnt read me and when i came back john was awake what is it little girl he said dont feel walking about what that hell get told i thought it was a good time to talk so i told him that i really was not dating him and i wished he would take me away why go away instead of me if i least would be up in three weeks and i cant see hows the lead before i dont know i cant see hows the lead before there are fears in my family home and i cannot possibly lead a challenge of some ill of course if you were in any danger i could and would but you really are better dear whether you can see it or not i am a doctor dear and i know youre getting flesh and color your appetite is better and i felt really much easier about you i dont wear a bit more said i nor as much and my appetite may be better in the evening when you are here but it is worse in the morning when you are away the last whole little farm said he would break their bones she shall be as sick as she pleases but now lets improve the shining hours by going to sleep dont talk about it in the morning and you wont go away i asked only why how can i dear it is only three weeks more and then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while ginny is getting the house ready really dear you are better better in body perhaps i beg your pardon i stop short but for a setup straight the mood to me was such a stern refreshed look that i could not say another word i beg your pardon dear for my sake and for our childs sake as well as for your own that you will never for one instance let that idea into your mind there is nothing so dangerous so fascinating to a temperament like yours it is a false and foolish fantasy can you not trust me as a physician whom i tell you so so of course i said no more my score and we went to sleep for four long he thought i was asleep first but i wasnt and lay there for hours trying to decide whether that blood pattern and that black pattern really did move together or separately on a pattern like this by daylight there is a lack of sequence but the fines of law live a constant irritant to a normal mind the color is hideous enough and unreliable enough and infuriating enough that the pattern is torturing you think youre mastered it but just as soon as you get well under reinfulging it turns a back somersault in there you are it slaps you in the face knocks you down and cramples the plane this is like a bad dream the outside pattern is a fluid hervest and a fungus if you can imagine a toadstool in joints an interminable string of toadstools thudding and scouting in endless convolutions why that is something like it that is sometimes there is one market materiality about this paper a thing nobody seems to notice by myself and that is that it changes as the light changes when the sun shoots in through the east window ive always watched that first long straight moon it changes so quickly that i never can quite believe it that is why i watch it every once by moonlight the moon shines in all night when there is a moon i wouldnt know it was the same paper at night in any kind of light then twilight candlelight lamplight and worst of all by moonlight it becomes bars yes ive had it i mean and the woman behind it is playing as can be i didnt realize for a long time what the thing was that showed behind that dim subtime but now i am quite sure it is alone by daylight she has to do but i fancy it as the pattern that features her still it is so puzzling they piece meat by it by the hour i lie down ever so much and john says hes working and to sleep all i can indeed he started to have it but i think he lied down for an hour and turned it is a very bad pattern i have to face but you see i dont see it and that cultivates the seat but i dont tell them on a week oh no i think ive seen a little thing of them it seems very very strange i think ive seen them as an inexplicable thing its strikingly interesting but i think ive seen a little thing of them but the fact that its a people i do not know and i think i know a little thing of them and coming through suddenly i looked through the solutions not for a several times looking at the paper and ginny too i thought ginny had her hand on her hands she didnt know what to do and you know shes trying to kill her she had very good thoughts and the most restraining of her possible what she was doing she turned around and said i guess if she had been touched here id be fighting her i should have been fighting myself and she said people say everything it talks i see a funny little experience of all my toys and toys i see a wishful thinking of her but the context now isnt but i am starting to study and im telling nobody to find out in myself life is so very much more exciting than it used to be this year i have something more to say im a little bit better and im more tired than i was ive gone so far to see the employee he wanted to live the other day and so i see a deep voice and i say why is it not your paper i tell you all the time i had no idea it was my challenge but it was because of the law paper he had made fun of me he might even want to take me away i dont want to leave now until ive found it out there is a week more and i think that would be enough that feeling ever so much better that ill sleep much at night that hes so interesting he wants to know me but i see a good deal in the daytime in the daytime its a nice and neat complexion there are always new sheets on the phones and new shades of yellow all over it i cannot keep counting them you are outside precious it is the strangest yellow of that law paper it makes me think of all the yellow things i ever saw all the beautiful ones are butter the old and the bad ones are nuts if theres something else about that paper the smell i noticed it the moment we came into the room there was so much fear and silence it was not fair now we have found a beat of fog and rain and part of the windows are open and not and the smell is still here it crinks all the way through the house confiding in the building and dining room stulting in the hall driving in the hall dining and waking on the stairs and listening to my kid even though ive been alive ive felt my head suddenly in surprises there is that smell of such a peculiar odor too i spent hours in the side of the hall staring at the smell of it it is not bad at first and very gentle but quite the subtlest most enduring odor ive ever met in this damp weather it is awful i wake up in the night and find it hanging over me it used to destroy me at first i thought seriously of burning my house to reach the smell but now im used to it the only thing i can think of is that it is like the color of the paper a yellow smell theres a very funny mouth on this one you lower down and figure the mouth board a street ranger and ranger it goes between every piece of furniture except the bed a long straight even smorch as if it had been rubbed over and over i wonder how it was done who did it and what they did it for round and round and round round and round and round it makes me dizzy ive really had to scubbish some people out for what reason would you know that i changed this sir i finally found it out the front fatter does move and i wonder the woman behind shakes it sometimes i think there are great many women behind and sometimes only one and she calls around fast and her crawling shakes it all over then in the very bright stars shell keep still and in the very shady spots she gets hit full of the bars and shakes them hard and shes all the time trying to climb through but nobody could climb through that pattern explain with sir i think that is quite theres so many heads they get through and in the pattern strangles them off and turns them upside down and makes their eyes fight those heads were covered with taken off and nothing could have so many i think that woman gets out in the daytime and ill tell you what but ive seen her i can see her out of every one of the windows it is the same woman i know where she is always creeping and most women do not creep by daylights i see her on that long road and her wings creeping around and her curious parts she hides under the blackbirded mountains i dont blame her bits they must be very humiliating to be creeping by daylights i also know her creep by daylights i cant even remember what i know john was a sex on three months and john is so queer now that i dont want to irritate him i wish he would take another wing besides i dont want anybody to get that woman out at night but myself i often wonder if i could see her out of all the windows at once but because as fast as i can i can only see out of one at a time and though i always see her she may be able to creep faster than i can turn ive watched her sometimes away also in the open trenches creeping as fast as a cloud shadow in a high room if only that tough cabin could be done off from the end of one i mean to try it little by little ive found out another funny thing that i shot teller at this time i was not even supposed to take too much there are only two more days to pick this paper up and i believe john is beginning to notice i dont like to look in his eyes and i heard him ask ginny a lot of professional questions about me she had a very good report to give her she said i slept a good deal in the daytime john knows i dont sleep very well at night but while im so tired i actually also took a fish tank to school i kept telling her to be very loving at night as if i could see through him still i dont wonder the answer to see if im going to be sleeping for three nights im just interested in her but i feel sure john and ginny are secretly affected by it hooray this is the last day but it is enough john is to stay in town overnight and hell be out until this evening ginny went to sleep with me this night but i told her i should endow it to be less better for a night all alone that was clever but i really wasnt alone in this as soon as it was noon i felt a thing began to fall and shake the pattern i got up and ran to help her i thought she was sick i felt she pulled and before morning we had killed all the yards of the paper i stripped about a square inch of my head and half around the room i didnt know when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me i declared i would finish it today wed go away tomorrow and theyre all moving all my furniture down again to read things as they were ginny looked at the long and amazing but thats all ive heard in the mirror and im getting a pure spite of the vicious thing she laughed and said she wouldnt mind doing it herself but i must not be tongueed im just a child of sin but i am a married person touches this paper but me not alone she tried to get me out of the room it was too painful but i said it was so quiet and empty and i believed out loud that i would get a sleep all i could and id wait there even for a day i would call the time and now shes gone every cell is gone and the things are gone and theres nothing left that would best every male bandit have ever done in his life im telling you you should sleep now hes still in his room im taking the phone as well im trying to enjoy the room and im leaving i always told you big story about you this big story is very long im sorry im not sure im not sure i dont want to go i dont want to be by the corner of the corner im sorry im sorry i dont want to go i dont want to be by the corner of the corner if that woman does get out and tries to get away i cant save her but i forgot i could never reach home without anything to stand on this bed will not move i tried to lift and push it until i was laying and then i got so angry i bit off a little piece of my finger but it hurt my teeth they are pure off all the paper i could make standing on the floor it sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it all those strangled heads and bulbous eyes and juggling fungus verse just shriek with vision im getting angry enough to be something desperate ive got to have a window with the admirable exercise but the bar is too strong and hard to come this arent very good but of course not i know well enough this step like that is being thought by a lightning mist in school i dont like to even look out of the windows there are so many of us creeping in and they creep so fast i would have been all clean out of that lock if i had a window but i am so clearly passing out but my world didnt work you dont get me out of nowhere here i suppose i should have a window that cant be covered by a night and that is boring it is so pleasant to be out in this great rain and i think around like things i dont want to go outside i wont you didnt have to genepass me to outside you have to think on the ground and everything is raining instead of the water but here i cant think of a smoother way to go and my shoulder just fits me that long smoother way to go so i do not need to go why there is a giant at the door there is no use running there anything right no its fine i know its crying for a mix there will be a shame to break down that beautiful door so im here said i in generous voice the key is down by the front steps and im trying to get in thats all im telling you for tonight what do you say im trying to get in what can you do i cant say the key is down by the front door and im trying to get in and then i said it again several times i really didnt mean to slow you i said it so long and you had to go to the sea but he got it for us and came out hes not short on the door what is the matter if you cry for gods sake what are you doing i kept on thinking of this machine but i looked at him over my shoulder i got out at last said i in spite of you and ginny and i pulled off most of the paper so you cant take me back now boy i should have never fainted but he did and ran across my path by the wall so that i had to creep over him every time then though the yolo i bit i tried to think of you you thought of me i am precisely your childhood mother october 2 2000
