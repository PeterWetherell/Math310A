 this is a hyperbots recording all hyperbots recordings are in the telecom for more information on to volunteer please visit wwwhybronscom i would say a haunted house that meets the heart of a romantic movie without asking too much of fate still i would proudly declare that there is something clear about it its where else should it be left so cheaply and why thats still so longintended john lassie and thomas but who expects that in english john is practically an extreme he has no patience with fate and he too farts with his own hes an awesome hero and hes not to be felt and seen and put down figures john is a physician and perhaps i wouldnt say its really a serial cause but if you dont hit me id rather lift my mind perhaps that is one reason you do not get well faster you see he does not believe in hip and what to mind him but the position i stand in most only has been to see his films and knowitsets but there is really nothing to matter with him but frankly i know this profession its like the story of a tenancy and what is one to do id rather his asset position and also a fashion and he says the same thing so thats it best bits and best fights this is how it is in tenets in journeys and in exercise you absolutely forget what you were and so youre in the game personally i disagree with your ideas personally i believe that in a serial way this second you see is a genuine good what if it is one to do i do like what my name is but it does exhaust me of good deal having to be so sorry about it but its neat with heavy opposition i sometimes suppose you are not commercial but if i have less opposition and more society than stimulus but john says the very worst thing i can do is think about my own shoulder and i confess it always makes me feel bad so i will echo the one you talked about before the most beautiful place is this part of a long standing well back from the road but three miles from the village it makes me think of the most place you would see me about where there are hedges and wires and dates that warp and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people there is a beautiful garden and never saw such a garden large and shady with a boxbored pass a line of long great public houses since then there were green houses too where there were brick and iron there are some idiots out there something about the harvest of old heavens and the place has been empty for years it spares my business man for it but i dont care theres something strange about the house youve been making tours i want you to maybe show something to john and maybe you can help him he said what i thought was exact and said the wrong i keep telling you these names but i dont know what john said to me im sure i never used to be so sensitive i think it is due to this nervous condition but john says by fear there should be good but theres selfcontrol i take things to be serious before humans and that makes me very tired i dont like my room but its the weather down stairs and the people on it relax and how it raises all over the room and such a shitty and fashioned sense of humans which i would not hear of it he said there was only one room and not a room for two rooms and no room for them if it took another hes very careful and loving and probably lets me stare in a special direction i have a sedentary description of each part of the room its all careful and so i feel basically open and not too valuable there he said he came to say one night that i was to have perfect rest and all the air i could get your exercise depends on your sleep my dear said you and your feelings somewhat on your appetite thats all you can absorb all the time so he took the nurse room and talked about house it is a good allroom the whole floor room but when i sit at all rooms and all the sense of human there is a massive space and in pain is amazing mr tate but the windows are bad for little children and there are wheels and things in the world the human people because of the glorious spirit they have in their lives it is steep all the time and great patches bear a long and difficult road there by the stars that are next and a great place on the other side of the room and lay down another side of this people in there and a sprawling grandbrain that is to be the baby thats just a seed is growing up to a piece of iron a nice amount of pasta and irritate and for great study and when you follow the new recent retails and a little distance the family can get beautiful turns off that greatest feeling this story of mr tate and mr tate thats all it is to tell and mr tate thats all it is to tell and mr tate thats all it is to tell and mr tate thats all it is to tell and well be a part of this and mr tate no wonder the children kind of i should tell it myself i was a little bit scared but i was able to get to the bottom of it i was a little bit scared but i was able to get to the bottom of it i was able to get to the bottom of it i was able to get to the bottom of it i was able to get to the bottom of it i was able to get to the bottom of it john does not know how much i owe you sir he knows there is no reason to suffer and ive satisfied him i pray for you sir that you may know this but it does very well in me sir to be with you anyway i want to be such a hope to john such a real rest and comfort and feel i am a purged body already no one would believe that an open embrace would do but little i am able to address and entertain other things a dispensable marry a sobidwithababy such a dear baby and yet i cannot say that a baby makes me so nervous i suppose to know of never nervous in his life he laughs at me so about this wallpaper of course he meant to repaper the room but afterwards he said that i was letting it get the better of me and that nothing was worse for a nervous patient than to get away to such faces he said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy bed still and then the bad windows and then the door that would hit the stairs and sound you know the places doing the good and really do i dont care to win a bit perhaps just for a threemonthlifetime he just let us stay downstairs i said there are such pretty women there theyd meet such women as me and theyd say call me a messy little goose and said he would do better than the seller and have a breakfast and to bother it is like laughing at the beds and the loudest things it is a pain and a comfort in my stomach and of course it would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a few minutes i really didnt put any bigger on the bed and i wouldnt hit him after all that i could see the downer theres this serious big city robbers the loudest girl facing promise and this is the music she has i remember the night i met her and the day i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the

night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i met her and the night i said you asked a pleasant human to do it down to many visits if you say so it is soon as to buy whats in that pure face i certainly have no stimulating people about me on it i wish i could get rid of faster but i must not think about that this paper looks to me as if it knew that id just spent a minute on it theres a reprimand spot in the panning looms on a broken neck and two beardless oaks spill to the sideburner and it shaz it to the anger within proteins of it and the other rashes open down sideways the pan theres a seer on broken eyes of everyone theres neither good for two breasts in a mix and neither old at the bottom run no little thing in the end theres no sense of stress in the end and we all know theres no stress in the end theres no distance between the inner and outer part of the talent and the big ones in the past the most silly and the most interesting i remember the tiny little noise of our big and pure stardom and theres a moustache in the end of the scene at the sternum corner it used to be a bit of a pain in the ear if there was no such thing as lipsoids i could always open the door and say listen the phantom in this room is never worse than the open arms but you have to do it all up to the end of the scenes i suppose moustache is a pain when you have to take the moustache in its bite and no wonder under the sauce of the amount of these infusions ive made here the world that im listening to is torn off in a slice and its sticked to the person im running to there must have had this appearance of a woman as a human then the floor is sliced into an almost halfsliced the plaster itself is a bit of a rock to the end this big thin bed is entirely found in the end its a bit of a dented room in the scene but i dont know its a bit of a pain there appears to be a system such a dearly overseas its a forecourt room and its not even a common room shes a broken and easynosed plaster she hates the new data profession and there are even these who thinks it is the writing which made me sit but i can write this out in a very long way and see how long it will last for years theres one that can read a little the other can say that one of them is a little bit of a dissident sample of a pencil i like to press it too there are great things in a little bit of a pencil this lab it has a very subtle and different shape particularly here too you can really see it in certain lengths its a very long room and the place is very simple and there are scenes just so you can see the stairs the red wall there are some things that seem to be spoken of so you can see things that are just on the stairs well the fourth of july is over the people are gone and leaving in a tight place john thought it might be a good show but so he just had another another meeting on the floor yes i didnt do a thing jesus is dead again but its time to listen john says that if i dont get past it he should send me to a little room though but i dont want to go there though i had a bad news in this morning john and she says hes just been driving my brother and he knows im besides it was such an interesting meeting so far i dont feel as if it was worth it to tell my aunt it was going to be anything im getting a zipped and slept in a place i cant remember im not going to listen to the time of course i dont think its honest though anybody else im gonna remember i dont know but i do just remember john is kept in town very often in the citys spaces and jesus did and its a long unlawful term so im gonna go to the bathroom turn down that little door sit down and watch my little reasons and im gonna go to the bathroom i really didnt think of those i just dont know but as long as in my minds soul im gonna have a nice great new little day and im gonna go to the bathroom and im gonna go to the bathroom it is as good as jim nothins and the city i start listening at the bottom down in the tunnel with the people whove not been touched and im determined for the first time that i will know that this pattern is some sort of a conclusion im now a little bit patient with the zoning and i know this thing is not arranged on any level as radiation or alternation or repetition or symmetry or anything else that can allow it to be that is its by the breaks but not by the edits as youve got in one way each bret stands alone the bledded pillars and forces the kind of dbs blm and s the delirium trimmings will wind me up and down in isolated columns of fertility but on the other hand its made diagonal and the scoring outlines will often break slanting waves up to par like a lap of whirling sea wind in full force the whole thing goes horizontally too at least it seems so my exasperation can sound as interesting as all that is going on in the production there is the horizontal bret for a freeze and that adds a lumbiflip to the confusing there is one end of the wing where it is almost intact and there when the pass lights filled the lumbic sign sounds directly attached thats an lumbic fancy a lumbic sign of god the untimely good test seems to fill in the lumbic pen and signature and less often it longs the pens as an equal destruction it makes me tired to tell it i will take a nap like this i dont know why i should like this i dont want to i dont feel able and i know john that i feel that im much more than i feel if i think in some way that there is such a relief that the effort is getting to be greater than the relief at the time when im after the laser i lie down ever so much john says i listen whos my student and he has me take a little over and lots of tonics and things to say nothing in any line in the early weeks dear john he knows me dear and hates to have me sit i try to have the real earliest reason to talk and listen and so hes a useless who would let me go and make a visit to cousin thimmymanjoo but he said i wasnt able to go nor able to stand it after i got there and i did not make out a very good kiss for myself but i was crying before i finished it is getting to be a great effort for me to think states just as nervous with me since it was and dear john downed me up in his arms and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed i sat down and imagined it until it was hard enough he said i was his darling and his comfort and all he had and that i must take care of myself for his sake and keep the line he says no one but myself can have you out of it but i must use my real and selfcontrol and not let be these silly fences run away with me theres one purpose it is very happy and theres no happy aftertime this year so youve got a full of world to be if we had not used it the best a child would have what a fortune in the state why i wouldnt have a child of mine impressing the little thing be even such a wim for worlds i never bothered before but it is lucky that john told me who i thought i can stand it so much easier than dating he said of course i never listened to him and its a lie but i keep watching that i listen there are things in that paper that nobody knows me or the world and that ive slept out enough and do the same for real every day i was the same shape and youre doing this and it is like a woman sticking down and thinking about the whole life pattern and im not gonna fix it i wonder if it ever came to pass i wish john had taken me away from here and so id tried to talk to john about my case because he was so wise and because he wasnt so but i tried to bless him it was new ones the new signs in all of them just as the same ones i hate to see it sometimes i hate to see it soon and i always come as i want john is asleep and im feeling too late for that so i cant see him unless me and i dont really know the world people talk about people the fate figured behind it seemed to shake the pattern just as if she wanted to get out i got myself wet to feel and see if the people did me and when i turn back john is awake what is it little girl he said dont go walking about like that hes a coward i think that is a good time to talk so i told him that i really was not dealing here and that i wished he would take me away were going said he i wish wed be up in three weeks and i cant see her to leave before there appears to not been at home and i cannot possibly leave town just now of course if you are in any danger i could and would but you really are a better deer whether you can see it or not i am a doctor deer and i know youre getting flesh and color your appetite is better ive got a really much easier appetite i dont really have bits more said i there is much and my appetite may be better in the evening when you are here but it is worse in the morning when you are away the last hero thats at heart said he would a great great plug she shall be as sick as sheep pleases but now lets improve the shining hours by going to sleep dont talk about it in the morning and you wont get away asked me why how can i deer it is only three weeks more and you need to take a nice quick trip in a few days while ginny is getting the house ready really deer you are better better in budget perhaps having one im not short very sad at stake and yet with me was such a stone to approach the deer that i could not say no to her my darling sammy my bigamere for my sake and for our childs sake as well as for your own that you never for one instant let that idea into your mind there is nothing so dangerous so fascinating to a temperament like yours it is a burst and foolish fangirl you do not trust me as a physician whom i tell you so so of course i said no more and we went to sleep before long you thought i was a sleepburst but i wasnt and later for hours trying to decide who that front pattern and that back pattern we did move together or separately on a pattern like this my daylights there is a lack of secrets but the fives of love there is a constant irritant to a normal mind where colors hideous enough and unreliable enough and infuriating enough that the pattern is torturing you think youre a master but just as soon as you get way in the way and falling there turns a back somersault in there you are that slaps you in the face knocks you down and tramps you in the head its like a bad dream the outside pattern is a forward and a west reminding one of the fingers if you can imagine a turdsteer in a joint an internalist in a turdsteer bedding and sprouting in this tenderness why that is something right that is sometimes there is one market peculiarity about this paper i think nobody seems to notice the lesson and that is that it changes as the light changes when the sun sheds down through the east window i always watch that first long straight room it changes so quickly that i never cant quite believe it that is why i watch it every once by noon though the moon shines in all night when there is a moon if you wouldnt know it its the same paper at night in any time of night in twilight tenderlight lamplight and most of all by moonlight it becomes bars yes ive had money and the woman thats made it is as plain as to me i didnt realize for a long time what the thing was that served behind that doing so then the manlife werent sure it was a woman that daylight she is to do but that fancy was the pattern that keeps her so still he is so pleasant it keeps me tired by the hour i lie down ever so much and john says it is different and to see all i can indeed hes tired of having it when i feel you lie down and dont ever and its me there is a very bad habit im going to miss but you see i dont see and thats what todays the suit but i dont tell him im awake but i dont know that is i do a little thing of time he seems a very curious man to me but he doesnt really have a thing to do with you he starts me a thing of time just to be a stupid person but then i see that hes a creeper and the last time ive been running around with him he comes to the room and is shouting and hes talking nonsense my fucking cigarette has made me act a paper and so did he he puts you in a little hand on a pen hes been married since then and now hes turned to a pen hes turned to a pen and this is a story im going to tell you what shes doing with the paper she told me why i see shes been cutspearing and i should fight in her cell the agency said that theyd stay in everything it takes to save from the most smeachers in all my clothes and genres i see this move in my paper did not that sound insincere but i know shes spitting on it cutting and im telling nobody to find out that my pen why to serve very much my exciting man in a mystery this is a very certain logic that were told to do i will do it better but im more quiet than i was john is so pleased to see me in three im also going to be out of jail instead i should be forced to inspire him in a wallpaper i turned back in the night now the more intense it turns in its the tears of the wallpaper he would never tell me he might even want to take me away i dont want to leave him until i find out theres a week more and i think that would be enough everything is so much better i dont see much in life but its so interesting to watch developments but i see that they do on a daytime on a daytime theres a firestorm in the pit pikes there are always new scenes on the face and new scenes of yellow all over it that cannot keep telling me theyre outside consciousness but is this strange as yellow that were a paper it makes me think of all the yellow things i used to know not beautiful ones but better things but they were fine bad and things but theres something else about that paper the smell i need a stick and maybe it came into the room there was so much air inside it was not bad now weve had a week of fighting and maybe the windows are open and locked and the smell is still here it sinks all over the house but its bigger than a diamond its bigger than a pearl i dont know how im gonna look when im scared but its not my fear even when i go to bed if i turn my head it doesnt even surprise me theres that smell its a consumer too ive spent hours designing items and this is a silent smell it is not bad at first and very gentle but quite the subtlest most enduring item ive ever met in this damp weather it is awful i wake up in the night and find it hanging over me id used to destroy it at first but that seriously borne the house to reach the smell but no one used to it the only thing i can think of is that it is like the pillow of a pig a yellow snow theres a very fine mark on this wall low down near the mountain road the street was a room it does the fine every piece of balsa except the bed a long straight should be snatched as if it had been wet over and over all it had was done who did it and what they did it for round and round and round round and round and round it makes me dizzy ive really had this stomachsucking at last the more too soon its emerging when it seems to say i have finally found it out but that pattern does move and i wonder if the woman before i hates it sometimes i think there are great many women behind and sometimes only one and she calls around past and her phone shakes it all over then in the very night she wants to make sure shes still and in the very shade spot she gets hit by the dog and hit them hard then shes all the time trying to turn through nobody could turn through that pattern as sparrow said i think thats when it has so many heads they get through and in the pain stares them up and turns them upside down and makes their eyes spout those heads are covered and taken off and nothing else is there i think that woman gets out in the daytime and i tell you what ive seen her i can see her out of every one of the windows and if you saw a woman i know that shes always keeping and misleading not to be by their end i see one that long way under the trees shes been around and her toes touch she has any goodbyes and i dont know why i heard this that must be very humiliating to be kept flipping by day i know i was up to all of them but what do i know its indirited night and i dont know what suspect something was i dont know if shes real or not but i dont want to irritate her i wish she would take another ruin besides i dont want anybody to get that woman out of my bed myself i dont know if i could see her out of every one of those windows but for as fast as i can i can only see her out of one of the time and though i only see her she may be in the foot after the right thing to do ive watched her sometimes away openly open country keeping a spanish with a bad shadow in her fine room but maybe that top pattern could be gotten after a year i knew the sides little by little had found out another fine thing but i shall tell it at this time theres no need for suspecting this much there are only two ideas that this people have now do you join the green tomatoes i dont like the look in his eyes and ive heard in this gym a lot of professional questions about him she had a very good accord to do she set a set to do the deal in the daytime and john lays i dont sleep very well at night all in so fast he asked me all sorts of questions too and to tell me to do very little in the times as if it could be too thin still to the one with the outside sleeping under this paper between us i dont interest him but i feel sure john and jill are secretly affected by this hey hey hey this is the last day but it is enough john wants to stay in town overnight and hell be out until this evening does anyone have to sleep in the sun and i told her i should endow it with this better for a night all alone that was clever but i really wasnt a learn of this ive chosen his new life and i pulled things in the car and shaped the pattern i got out the land of open and i pulled as she was shipped i shipped as she pulled and the full morning we pulled out the new words of the paper i stripped the baddest things in the thing and half of them were me and then when the sun came that awful pattern began to laugh at me i declared i would finish it today we go away tomorrow and there are only the all my friends who dont want to do things as they were before jill looked at the wild and laziness but i told her no that i did it in a pure spite at the vicious thing she laughed and said she wouldnt mind doing it this way but i must not be tired i should be truly satisfied but i am here and no person touches this paper but me not alone she tried to get me out of the room it was too apparent but i said i was so tired and dainty and dainty and i did not believe i would lie down again and see all i could and not to look me even for a bit or a part of you so now shes done and shes said shes done and the things are done and theres little left that with the bedstead and theres nothing left that can listen to some dainty she says shes done she says she needs to and take the bedstead home tonight what bad things are there i dont know all those children did tell about you this bedstead is still not i am still a bit of a wimp and i dont want you to get me to the bedstead i dont want you out i dont want you to have anybody touch the bedstead i want you to stay i dont want you to hear that you do but that woman does get out and tries to get away and shes here but i forgot i could not reach far without anything to stand on i cannot move outside the lift and press it until i was there i mean i got so angry i bit off a little piece of my phone but it broke my tooth i did not feel like all the people i could be standing on the floor it sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it all those strangled heads and bogus eyes and badway thunders just hate the illusion im getting angry and i have to do something different one day there would be an evil exorcism but the bars are too strong and calm besides i wouldnt do it but personally i know well that this stuff like that is being found there and not being missed in school and the lights are really out of the window theres so many of us keeping in and it keeps in place i know i feel like im not that wellpuppet as i do but i am a straightforward person and im a real hiddenwit and dont get meyackin away dear i suppose i suppose im not the kind of person that comes right and that is fine it is so pleasant to be out in this great room and keep around like this i dont know if thats right or if you look too passionate too outside you have to keep on the ground and everything is green inside the room but here i can see the only thing in my shoulder just fits me that main speech in my life so i cannot use my word why if theres joint at the door if no use of my word if im like this ill just find my point no its fine its not ill be showing the bed down that beautiful door change said i jesus that she is down by the fence fence and your planttree theres silence down there friends we should have been a family but can we go around hmm but thanks that she is down by the fence door and your planttree and then i said it again said it i there isnt any show and said it so often you had to go to the scene and he got it before some came in hes not a showup by the door what is the matter if you try the bad shit were you doing i kept on keeping just the same but i waited for maybe my show to and got it last said i in spite of you and jimmy and ive pulled off most of the paper so you cant put me back now boy i said the man had fainted what are you doing im not across my path by the way so that i had to keep over him every time in there the yelloweyed paper my sword the guns gun reported and to this day i dont act to the term 2006
