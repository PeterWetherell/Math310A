 this is a report on support all report on support is in the public domain for more information and to volunteer please visit wwwrubybubyorg i would say a haunted house and mix the fight of romantic felicity without the asking too much of fate still i am proudly declared that there is something poor about it what else should it be less than cheaply and why this did so untimely john laughs at me when i see him but one expects that of a marriage john is practical in the extreme he has no patience with fate and since all of this is possible he is not to be felt and seen and put down in figures john is a physician and perhaps as you can see this is a dead paper and a great relief to my mind perhaps that is one reason i do not get well fast enough you see he does not believe i am sick in what can one do but the physician finds stone in his own husband who shows friends and relatives that there is really nothing to matter to him but potentially near this depression a slight hysteria tendency what is one to do a brother is also a physician and also a facturer and he says the same thing so i take both states and both states whichever it is and tactics and journeys and air and exercise and absolutely use the pivot of the whip and so on and on again personally i disagree with their ideas personally i believe in genuinely the excitement and change that do me good but what is one to do i believe that from my perspective i believe that there is a good deal having to be so sly about it or else meet with heavy opposition i sometimes spares me about the issue of if i have less opposition in a new society than stimulus but john says the very worst thing i can do is think about my own issue and i confess that all this makes me feel bad so i will look it in the eye and talk about the house it was a beautiful place that is quite a long standing well back from the road quite three miles from the village it makes me think of english places which you read about where there are hedges and walls and dates that lack and lots of separate little fizzes for the gardeners and people there is a delicious garden i never saw such a garden large and shady with a boxed bloated pass and limegrilled redcovered olives and a suit of honey they were green houses too theyre all broken now there was some legal trouble something about the village ive always been anyway that place has been empty for years that spares my gursiness i am afraid but i dont care theres something strange about that im sure you can make out for this i even saw something strange in the town this is what i thought was a drop in the shelter room i get unreasonably angry with john sometimes im sure i never used to be so sensitive i think it is due to this nervous condition but john says by fear so theres only black black selfcontrolled so i take pains to control myself im so human that makes me very tired i dont like our unique face i waited long downstairs i put them on the floor and had roses all over the room in such pretty oldfashioned sensehanging with john and matt here of us he said there was only one woman and not one for two days and no near mean for him if he took another hes very careful and loving and hardly lets me stare at a special direction i have a severe prescription for each eye on the day he takes all the care from me and so i feel evasive and vocal not too valuable to him he said he came here so young and i was to have perfect rest and all the air i could get your exercise depends on your strength my dear and your fear somewhat on your appetite but fear you can absorb all the time so he took the nursery out of the top of the house it is a big airy room the whole floor in there with windows in the cool waves and air and sunshine in the air it is a nursery first and in prayer room is a major nursery church with windows in the house of little children and there are reams and things in the house even people look at the way this room is built it is stripped off and built in great patches all around the home and the bed about as far as i can reach and in a great place on the other side of the room and very back i never saw worse people in a small flamboyant house meeting everyone just to see there are enough to infuse the air in the house and master the pristine inferiority of the great study and when you follow the new uncertain theories and little business the funnypoint suicide ends up in great disdain the story of the son of the king the trouble of the town the only thing that happened the story of the king the story of the son of the

son of the king the story of the son of the king the story of the son of the king the story there comes john the most pitiful man who hates to have a knight weve been here two weeks and we havent felt like writing for him since that first day im sitting by the room all the while up in his atrocious inertial and theres nothing to handle my writings as much as i please john is away for a day and even some nights when his cases are serious im glad my case is not serious but these nervous people have dragged the rightful depressant john does not know how much i really suffer he knows theres no reason to suffer and im satisfied with him i pour for this only nervousness it does bring me so much to be my leader anyway i meant to be such a head to john such a real west and company and here i am a comparative burden already no one would believe that an epitome of those to deal with living and living to dress and entertain and other things that his fortunate marry a so good little baby such a dear baby and yet i cannot sleep with him it makes me so nervous i suppose john was never nervous in his life he laughs at me so about this wallpaper at first he meant to repaper the room but afterwards he said i was letting it leap the better of me and that nothing was worse for a nervous patient than to give way to such fences he said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy bedstead and in the barbed windows and in the door to the head of the stairs and so on and you know the place is doing it good he said and really dear i dont care to renovate a house just for a three months winter indeed let us go downstairs i said there are such pretty rooms there then he took me in his room and called me up and listed little things and said he would go down to the cellar and have a white wash and he was like a man to knock the beds and the mirrors and things it is an area uncomfortable in this area in new york and it would not be some civil servants to make him uncomfortable with just a little bit of water im really getting quite fond of the room thats an onion room i can see the down there theres mysterious big shaded areas for young irish colorfishing friends and bushes and round trees see the middle see the middle see the middle im going to the cellar there is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there for a house i am dispensing i see people walking in these newest paths and angles but johns mission will not be worth your energy he says that with my imaginative power and habit of story making a nervous weakness like mine has brought me to need to all manner of excited fences and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tennis so i try i think sometimes and its only very much a right thing they relieve the press of ideas and wrestling but i find i get pretty tired when i try i am so dispirited not to have any advice and companionship about my work when i get really well john says i ask doesnt he do well down for a long visit he says he would as soon as put fireworks in that field i say let me have those stimulating people about me i wish i could get well fastened but i must not think about that this paper looks to me as if it knew that id wish its been fermented theres a burnt spot of utter noise that ive broken out and too bad this is a story change or something i get positively angry with the importance of it and the everlasting open down sideways they come theres a scene i believe in and i dont ever theres neither grace nor too much in the image and the eyes go open down in line and the little heart in the air makes some expression in the air and we all know how much expression lies in the sense that we get entertained by the terror and the deep effects of food and food and most children find it interesting i remember that i finally read the novels about a big old bureau in the stars and there was a man who shared a very simple book of story and a friend i used to feel that if any of the other things looked too fierce i could always shut things to that shape and listen the furniture in this room is no worse than anything in this room but we had to be all up for it in the stairs i suppose when this was used as a theory we had to take the nursery from this house and no wonder i never saw such a radicalism in childrens harmony here the wall of evidence is torn apart in the stars and the stick of the fish in my belly it must have had a push of variance in the very same way then the floor is scratched and the house is scratched the faster it sucks the better it feels its a great hidden pair its a very funny one its a different thing to wear in the stars but i dont mind the bits and pieces there comes john the sister such a dear girl she is hes so careful in her and hes not one of the funny ones shes a good and enthusiastic artist and helps a new better profession i very believe she thinks it is the right one which made me sit but i can write the truth all along you see how manly i am in my music there is one that commands the way i love and i shade it in and then it just looks like im in a fancy i love the fancy too theyre great hands and i love it in my music this man in the paper has a kind of scent in the gift of shoe a particularly irritating one i look at his feet in certain lines and i feel it there and in places that isnt filled and where the sun is just set i can see the stars in the sky there are some things that seems to spark about but im not sure that im expecting this from him theres just one thats there well the 4th of july is over the people have gone and died in tired times john thought it might be a bit of a silly old couple so he just had another in there and the children died in the evening folks i didnt do a thing jinnys in the stairway tonight but its hard to listen john says i dont fuck with you i shall see you tomorrow mitchell in the phone but i dont know what to do very well i had a friend who was in this kind of house and she says he was just like john and my brother only more so besides it was such an indetectable place to live i dont feel as if it was worthwhile to turn my hand over to anything and getting dreadfully fed from in front of us i find myself wasting time of course i dont have john here anybody else i find myself in a good deal just now johns kept in town very often in serious cases and jinny is dead and its not a long time until im out of here so i walk away to the new town i dont know what to do any more sit on the porch im going to lose this im not going to appear to you im really getting tired of being in this place its the truth it dwells in my mind so im not going to be in this great and neither good place it is near and far im tired of that im not going to be there it is as good as doing masters on the street i start at the bottom down in the corner of the building is not being touched and i determine for the thousandth time that i will or that pointless pattern is some sort of a confusion i know a little of the principle of design and i know this thing is not arranged on any lens of radiation of alternation of repetition or symmetry in nothing else that i may not be able to do i can do it too good for this by the breadth but not otherwise meet that in one way each breadth stands alone the bloated pores and foreshes a kind of debased brominesc with delirium trimmings will wobble up and down in isolated columns of fertility but on the other hand they can make diagonally and the sprawling outlines are in these glinting waves up to come like a lot of rolling seas thats in their chase the whole thing does horizontally too at least it seems so and i exhaust myself and try to squeeze the pores thats doing the production there is a horizontal breadth for a phase and that adds one difference to the confusion there is one end of the ring where it is almost intact and there in a crosslike state an elation shines directly with paint i can almost fancy the elation at all the intonable tests seem to form around the common season and wash off their hateloaned cleanses of equal destruction it makes me tired fellas i will take a nap i guess i dont know why i should like this i dont want to i dont feel able and i know johnny that i feel so that i must say that i feel i think in some way that there is such a relief that the effort is getting to be greater than we need half the time i am awfully lazy and lie down ever so much jones says i miss it and hes my student and he has me take a little over and lots of tunics and things to say nothing of a and y in where it meets dear john he loves me dearly and hates to have me sick i try to have a real earnest reason to talk with him and tell him his issues would let me go and make a visit to cousin penny and do it what he said i wasnt able to do nor able to stand it after i got there and i did not make out a very good case with myself for i was crying before i finished it is getting to be a great effort to me to think states this is nervous your princess of knowledge and dear john gathered me up in his arms and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed and sat by me and liked me until the time he said i miss his dog and his comfort and all he had and that i must take care of myself for his sake and keep well he says no one but myself can help me out of it but i must use my will and selfcontrol and not let any silly fences unwaver me were one comfort the baby is well and happy and theres no answer to occupy this mercy but a quarrel of war with it if we had not used it the blessed child would have what a fortunate escape why i wouldnt have a child of mine an impression of the little thing living such a lean for worlds i never thought of it before but it is lucky that john had taken me here after all i can stand so much easier than they do you see of course i never mentioned to him and to us but i keep watching it all the same there are things in that paper that nobody knows or never will when youre outside the pattern you do the shape of the wheel every day it follows the same shape and youre very mean and it is like a woman stepping down and creeping about behind that pattern i dont like it if its a wonder of a thing to think about i wish john would take me away from here when youre still hard to talk to john about my tastes the taste of his soul lies and the taste of his love is in the soul but i try to bless him it is moon nights the moon shines in all around just as the sun does i hate to see it sometimes but i think so slow now it comes out of my body john is asleep and im ready to wake him up so i text him and watch the moon and i think of you lady and i and i think of you until i fuck you the fate and figure behind it seems to shape the pattern just as if she wanted to get out i get up soft and i want to feel i see if the people didnt and when i came back john was awake what is it little girl he said dont go walking about like that you get cold i thought it was a good time to talk so i told him that i really was not gaining here and that i wished he would take me away my darling said he our lease will be up in three weeks and i cant see how to leave before there appears to not that at home and i cannot possibly leave town just now of course if you are in any danger i could and would but you really are better dear whether you can see it or not i am a doctor dear and i know you are gaining flesh and color your appetite is better i felt way much easier about you i dont wear bits more said i more as much and my appetite may be better in the evening when you are here but it is worse in the morning when you are away the last holy little heart said he with a great big plug she shall be as sick as she pleases but now lets improve the shining hours by going to sleep and talk about it in the morning and you wont go away i ask you why how can i dear it is only three weeks more and then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while ginny is getting the house ready really dear you are better better in body perhaps i began and stopped short for he sat up straight and muted me with such a stern reproachful look that i could not say another word my darling said he why beg of you for my sake and for our childs sake as well as for your own that you will never for one instant let that idea into your mind there is nothing so dangerous so fascinating to a temperament like yours it is a false and foolish fantasy can you not trust me as a physician you might tell you so so of course i said no more on this and we went to sleep together he thought i would sleep first but i wasnt and later for hours trying to decide whether that front padding and that back padding really did move together or separately on a padding like this by daylight there is a lack of sequence or the violence of law that is a constant irritant to a normal mind where color is hideous enough and unreliable enough and infuriating enough that the pattern is torturing you think youre a master but just as soon as you get well underway and fallen it turns up back somersault and there you are it selects you in the face knocks you down and troubles you plenty this is like a bad dream the outside pattern is a floored arabesque reminding one of the famous if you can imagine a toadstool in joints an interneable stream of toadstools bedding and sprouting in endless convolutions why that is something like it that is sometimes when there is one market peculiarity about this paper i think nobody seems to know this by myself and that is that it changes as the light changes when the sun sheds in through the east window i always watch that first long straight year it changes so quickly that i never can quite believe it that is why i watch it always by moonlight though the moon shines in all night when there is moonlight i wouldnt know it is the same paper at night in any kind of light in twilight candlelight lamplight and most of all by moonlight it becomes bores the outside pattern i mean and the women that find it as as plain as can be i didnt realize for a long time that the thing was that showed behind that dim subpoena but now i am quite sure it is a moon by daylight she is subdued quiet i fancy it as the pattern that suits her so still she is so pleasant that she is meekwide by the hour i lie down ever so much and john says it is beautiful and to sleep all i can indeed he started a habit on making me lie down for an hour to each me there is a very bad habit i am convinced but you see i dont sleep and that cultivates the sleep for i dont tell them im awake oh no the fact is im being really afraid of them he seems very innocent i suppose and even jean hasnt expected it yet it strikes me it seems that this is a scientific hypothesis the hypothesis is the paper ive watched johnny who did not realize anything and coming to the moon is hot and im in this innocent species left walking several times and making me act the paper and 22 ive tried to do the handon at once she didnt know what to do and you know what to do that its so very fun its the most restraining of my person what she was doing with the paper she turned around and said she had been touched by you and youd put it in my ass and you know why i should frighten her so then she said that the paper stained everything it touched and she found millions of inches of all my clothes and jeans and she wished me would be much safer did not that sound innocent but i know she was studying the paper and i am becoming nobody should find out but myself why it is so very much more exciting than it used to be is that i have a selfinformed aspect to look forward to to watch i will be better and im more quiet than i was johnnys safe means to see me intrigued he laughed at me the other day and said i seem to be forced and its quite a bit of my wallpaper i turned the ball for him i had no intention of telling him it was because of the wallpaper he would make a ton of money he might even want to take me away i dont want to leave him until i find out there is a week more and i think that would be enough im feeling even so much better i dont sleep much at night but it is so interesting once it develops but i see the good deal in the daytime in the daytime it is tiresome and complex there are always new shits on the phone there are new shades of yellow all over it i cannot keep changing them but i have tried conscientiously but is this strange as yellow without wallpaper it makes me think of all the yellow things i ever saw not beautiful ones like butterflies but they have found bad new things but there is something else about that paper the smell i noticed that the minute we came into the room there was so much air and sun it was not bad now we have had a week of bargain money and whether the windows are open or not the smell is still here it creeps all over the house i find it heavy when im done with it spiking in the car hiding in the house and im enraptured on the stairs it puts me in a head even when i go to ride if i turn my head suddenly and surprise it there is that smell its such a peculiar thing to do i have spent hours in silence and its a sign that its smelling it is not bad at first and very gentle but quite the subtlest most enduring odor i have ever met and as damp weather it is awful i wake up in the night and find it hanging over me it used to disturb me at first i thought seriously of burning the house to reach the smell but now im used to this the only thing i can think of is that it is like the cooler of the paper by yelling smell theres a very funny mark on this banner to low down youll hear the mark a street runs around the moon it goes behind every piece of furniture except the bed and long streets even smooch as if it had been rubbed over and over i never had this done who did it and what they did it for round and round and round round and round and round it makes me dizzy i really had to stub or something at once i watched it so much and now im going to change this son i have finally found it out the flip pattern does move and no wonder the woman behind shakes it sometimes i think there are great many women behind and sometimes only one and she comes around fast and her phone shakes it all over then in the very bright spots she sees still and in the very shady spots she just breaks through to the doors and breaks them hard and shes all the time trying to climb through but nobody could climb through that pattern exclaiming so i think thats when it has so many heads they get through and then the pattern strongly is a mark and turns them upside down and makes their eyes bright those heads are covered and taken off and not passed away i think that woman gets out in the daytime and i tell you the phone i see her i can see her out of every one of the windows it is the same woman i know where she is always creeping and most women do not creep by daylights i see her on that long road by the trees shes all alone i have a carriage pass she hides under the white nightvines i dont blind her at this it must be very humiliating to be creeping by daylights i always knock the door open at night by daylights i cant do it at night i know john would suspect something of us and john is so clear now that i dont want to irritate him i wish he would take another woman besides i dont want anybody to get that woman at night but myself i hope to remember if i could see her out of every window as it is at the time as fast as i can i can only see her out of a window at a time and though i always see her she may be able to step faster than i do trying i wash her sometimes away open the open country freakiness dashes a cloudshutter in a frying wind if only that tap pattern could be gotten off in the end of it i knew to try it little by little i found out another funny thing that i sharptear at this time it was not me who trusted him too much there are only two more days to get this paper off and i believe john is beginning to notice i dont like to look in his eyes and i heard him ask a lot of professional questions about him she had a very good report to give she said i slept a good deal in the daytime john knows i dont sleep very well at night i only sleep at night he has an eye search of fish in his food and the food is very lovely in the pond as if i couldnt see through him still i dont wonder he acts so sneakily under this paper for three nights but i dont know what interests him but i feel sure john and jim are secretly affected hello this is the last day that it is enough john is to stay in town over night and hell be out until this evening jim you wanted to sleep with me this afternoon well i told her i should undoubtedly rest better for a night all alone that was clever but i really wasnt alone a bit as far as it was moonlight and that poor thing began to fall and shape the pattern i got up and ran to her for it i pulled and she shook i shook and she pulled and the full morning we appeared over the yards of the paper i stood about as high as my head and half around the room and then in the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me i declared i would finish it today we go away tomorrow and theyre all moving all my furniture down again to where things as they were to be seen jimmy looked at the wall in the mazes but i told her mirrorly that i did it out of pure spite of the vicious thing she laughed and said she wouldnt mind doing it herself but i must not get tired of how she would tell you this but i am here and no person touches this paper but me not alone she tried to get me out of the room it was too apparent but i said it was so quiet and empty and empty now that i believed i would lie down again and sleep all night through i went to work and we were even for dinner i would fall down the roof so now she had gone had a servants at home and the things are gone and there was nothing left of that great bedstead and they were all down and we would turn this mattress and find it we used to sleep down the stairs tonight and take the bed and turn it what body did we need you know you dare you huh how you those children did tear it out here this bedstead is very long and i just took a look at the bed and turned it into the i dont want to go out i dont want to have anybody come to me and do something i dont want to spend a day with a few people i dare you to look up here to eat and do something if that woman does get out and tries to get away it can save her but i forgot i could not reach far without anything to stand on this bed we not move i tried to lift and push it until i was laying and then i got so angry i bit off a little piece of one corner but it hurt my teeth then i peered off all the paper i could reach standing on the floor it sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it all this strangled heads and baledass eyes and wobbly plump disgraced just fight with joyousing im getting angry enough to do something desperate the jump out of the window would be admirable exercise but the bars are too strong and hard to find the size i would endure of course not i dont know and this step like that is the important one might be mismisscured i dont like to even look out of the windows there are so many of those creeping women and they keep singing i wonder if theyre all coming out of that little paper as i do but i am securely passing by by my wellhidden rope you dont get me out of the way there i suppose i should have to just have to find the pattern when it comes night and that is poor it is so pleasant to be out in this bright wing and creep around like this i dont want to feel sorry or hate even if jim asked me to outside you have to creep on the ground and everything is burning inside the room but here i can feel smoothly on the floor and my shoulder just sticks in that long smooth chair on the wall so i cannot lose my way why there is joy at the door its no use young man you cant open it i have just done this for nine times now hes crying for the apps it would be a shame to break down that beautiful door fine dear said i in the genesis that she has done better from steps and youre playing telling me theres science in this room you see what do you feel i can feel it open the door i cant see it feels down by the front door and there are crying things and then i said it again several times very gently slowly he said it so often and had to go in the sea and he got it of course and came in hes not sure about it all what is the matter if you try the gods sake what are you doing i kept on creeping and just the same but i lifted him over my shoulder i got out of your left said i in spite of you and zinni and i pulled up most of the paper so you cant put me back now why should the man have fainted what he did and right across my path by the wall so that i had to creep over him every time then there the door opened i showed the papers door report it back how long ago thomas wil how long october 2 2006
