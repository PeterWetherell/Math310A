 this is a readable recording i read the watch recording on the internet the more information that you want to hear is visited wwwdaptorealcom i love you i love you let me tell you that you must be this such a true leadership and definitely a very valuable my charlotte puppies girl it is very seldom in your ordinary people i join myself securing such profiles for the same a colonial mansion a hereditary estate i would say a haunted house and rich the fight of romantic philosophy but that would be asking too much of fate still i would proudly declare that there is something pure about it but why else could it be less so cheaply and why that stays a long untimely john laughs at me in the face but no one expects that in my area john is practical to me extreme he has no patience to think and in fit thought he is a possible not to be thought and seen and put down in figures john is a tradition and perhaps i dont know if im living so well but this is a great fit and a great relief to my mind perhaps that is one reason i do not live so well in that state you see he does not believe i am fit and what commanding but that the fit man cant stand and knows only heaven that there is thin and military that there is really nothing to matter with me but thinking of him in nervous depression or slightly scared of intimacy and what is wrong to me my brother is also a proficient man and also a kind man and he is also a good man so i take both faiths and false thoughts whichever it is and tonics and journeys and air exercise and absolutely forget them and i take them all again personally i disagree with your ideas personally i believe that if you kneel and if you sit and change you do me good but what is one to do weve got faith in this matter but it dies in selfsufficiency if youre having to be so sly about it or else you meet with heavy opposition i sometimes stand to be in opposition but if i have less opposition in the real society than the stimulus what john says is the very worst thing i can do is think about my position and i confess it always makes me feel bad so i will let it alone and talk about the house the most beautiful place that is quite alone standing well back from the road like three miles from the village it makes me think of english placing on two new roads where there are hedges and walls and gates that lock and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people theres a delicious garden i never saw such a garden large and shady full of boxboarded paths and lined with long great covered arches with silk tannins there are greenhouses too but theyre all broken now there was some legal trouble i could do something about the poverty of food haters finally the place has been empty for years that spoils my merciless i am afraid but i dont care theres something strange about the house i can feel it i mean he said something john i mean he said what i felt was abrupt and sharpblown i get then reasonably angry with john sometimes im sure ive never used to be so sensitive i think it is due to this nervous condition but john said if i feel so i should regret the thought of selfpreciel so i take the urge to be sure of myself before him and that makes me very proud i dont like how you are i want to go downstairs with the people im in contact with and i know its only in the room in such pretty old fashion its hanging but john will not hear it he said there was only one room and not one for two rooms and no new room for him if he took another hes very careful and loving and finally thats me still not special than it can i have a scheduled prescription for each morning though he takes all care of me and so i feel basically ungrateful not to know youre there he said we came here solely on my own if i was to have perfect rest and all the air i could get your exercise depends on your strength my dear said he and your food somewhat on your appetite but you can absorb all the time so we take the measure of the top of our heads you didnt do anything the whole floor the windows of the building and air and sunshine everywhere and the main street the main playground is amazing the windows are marked with the children and there are wings and things in the wall the main thing to take a look at is a good morning school it was spittal but the great catch was the morning when you hit the road now the stars are in the moon and in a great place on the other side of the moon and there was a song of worst people in the world and a little song of grandforbidden events that made him able to exist it was a lonely and easy morning and most of all most of you feel the same and the books tell you and when you fall you may be set in stone and when youre in despair you may be sent to make excuses you dont even know where youve been you spoil yourself and when youre in pain youre falling in love and when youre in pain you may be set in stone and when youre in pain you may be set in stone no you will never be set in stone set in stone no wonder the children are painted this way i should paint it myself if i had to live in this rain alone there comes john i must put this away he hates to have it left weve been here two weeks and i havent felt like writing for him since that first day im sitting in the barbell in the room happiness is precious and merciless and theres nothing to hinder my writing as much as i please said blackstone john is awake all day and even some nights when his cases are serious im glad my case is not serious these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing john does not know how much i really suffer he knows theres no reason to suffer and ive saddened him but the lord says im in nervousness theres a way on this earth not that we might be in any way i need to be such a help to god such a real mess to the public and here i am compared to the lord in all ways no one would believe what he ever did but the little i made dress and entertain and other things it is fortunate an area so good for the baby such a dear baby and yet i cannot speak with him it makes me so nervous i suppose john was never nervous in his life he laughs at me so about this little paper at first he meant to repaper the room but afterwards he said that i was letting it rip the better of me and that nothing was worse for a nervous patient than to give way to such fancies he said that after the wallpaper was changed that it would be the heavy bedstead and then the barred windows and then the dated and the heavy restaure and so on and he knows the place in which im here and i really do i dont care if i renovate and help just for a threemonth sliver then do let us go downstairs i said there are such pretty windows there then he took me in the morning to find me a blessed little room and said he would go down to the ceiling and have a white wash under the bottom but heres whats enough about the bed and when he was in pain it is an air of uncomfortable room and me wanting to use that hand for it i would now be so silly to make him unpumped just for a few minutes im really getting quite the volume while im having a little paper i dont want anyone to know i can see that theres mysterious deepshaded air and i just pour a passion for it i wish thered been more of my dreams i dont know if i could help you but id rather youd be right at the door belonging to the estate theres a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house i always fancy i see people walking on these numerous paths and others but down theres nothing there not to be a word that depends on the least he says that with my imaginative power and habit of storymaking a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manners of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency so i try i think sometimes if i were only well enough to write for you they would leave the press of ideas in lesson but i find i get pretty tired when im trying it is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my work when i get really well john says well have cousin henry and julia down for a long visit but he says he would as soon as put fireworks in my philippines i still let me have those stimulating people about my arm i wish i could get there fast but i must not think about that this paper looks to me as a bit needy with ambitious thinking theres a dark spot for 20 years of a broken room and two verbose arms stare to the outside of me i get positively angry with the importance of it and everlastingness up and down the sunwrapped palm and as it sears in the northern mountains of everywhere and neither pretty nor plan certain length nor sensual abandonment leans into thine streets no setting maokes perspiration on�� grows we all know the much special energy in this world the man who came in this era had a great balance between friends and most children from new torre sto i remember the tiny week the mugs about eight other bureau staff and those mindshare only seemed like a spying friend i used to feel that if any of the other friends were true friends i could always talk to them about the children from dc the furniture in this room is no worse than anything in this room but you have to be all up to your own mistakes i suppose to listen to the music of the program and take the music from this room i know why i never saw something like it in the childrens room in here the wall of the room is so small and small it sticks it closer when running it must have had a personal room to the lowest people then the floor is smashed and the ground is stung and the rest of the cell is been up to the moon this great hidden bed is a tiny tiny room which is a little bit bigger than the room look at that little man in the room look at those glasses such a dear girl she is hes so careful of her and this not what im telling you shes a perfect man and hes a master of classical he hopes for no better profession but very blue she thinks it was the lighting which made her sit look at that little man in the room hes even long enough to move theres one in the room i love the shade of the moon the moon just looks after me and everything i love the country too theres great mountains and other mountains this wall of the program looks something like a chair i particularly hate to know but i think when you see it in certain rocks youll look good on the moon many places for a zippin and only some just so let me see a screen which will open four more for me it seems to be spoken of and im going to see im going to see if it opens up theres this young stairs well the fourth of july is over the people are gone and running and turning around i dont know if im going to leave this room alone theres this young man in the room and im sure theres another one i dont know if im going to leave jimmy says to me you know but its time to go john said hello i said if i see you tomorrow youre going to be gone but i dont know if im going to leave i dont know if im going to leave and he says to me just like john and my brother dont leave me alone so its such an empty room and i dont know if im going to leave dont feel as if it was worth it turn my hand over from anything and im getting dreadfully fretful and proud im fine im fine im fine im fine of course i dont feel honest here or anybody else i dont know if im going to leave i dont know if im going to leave i dont know if im going to leave johns kept in town very often on serious cases and jimmys heard that hes long enough to leave so i walk over the room and im gone im down at the lobby and i sit on the porch and im away and im down at the lobby and im going to leave im really going to find a way to make this a good thing im going to go to the pub it dwells in my minds soul i lie here and its a great thing to move it again its a male thing ive followed that time in that pub ive been doing it for a good amount of time and im doing it i start to listen but the bottom of the pub over there has not been touched and i determine for the thousand times that i will follow that pointless pattern of some sort of a confusion i know a little of the principle of design and i know this thing was not arranged on any laws of radiation or alternation or repetition or symmetry or anything else that im not familiar with i do that to do with the purpose by the grace but not other looked at in one way each breath stands alone the bloated curves and fourishes a kind of debased braminette with delirium trimmings theyre wobbling up and down in isolated columns of fertility but on the other hand they can make the agri and the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting waves up the corner like a lot of wobbling sea waves with full taste the full thing does the horizontal thing at least it seems so i exhaust myself in trying to continuously follow this boring imagination theyve eased the horizontal breath for a few seconds and that adds wonderful confusion theres one in the room where its almost open and there when it costs like a spade my little tongue shines directly at them thats one of those things that im reacting at the incredible depth thats going to fill in around the coming season and rush back to the terrible affinity that people have described it makes no time to follow it i will take a nap on this i dont know why i should write this i dont want to i dont feel legal i know johnny that youre a conservative and im not the same as what i feel and think that you suddenly prepare to such a relief but the effort is going to be greater than your relief half the time im left with a relief and lie down ever so much johnny says i mustnt lose my spirit and he has me take too much of a role and lots of tonics and things to say nothing ao and yo and you will need dear john he loves me dear and hates to have me sick i tried to have a real earnest reason to talk to him in the evening and tell him that i wish hed let me go and make a visit because the thing would be ruined but he said i wasnt able to go no i was able to stand it after i got there and i did not make out a very good case for myself where i was crying before i finished it is getting to be a great effort for me to finish this this is never something i should lose and dear john gathers me up in his arms and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed this sat on my head for the entire night he said i was his darling his comfort and all he had and that i must take care of myself for this and keep well he said he knew one but myself to help me out of it that i must use my evil and selfcontrol and not make deely silly fancies on a way of me theres one topic the baby is growing happy and doesnt that have to occupy this nursery with a very good thing if we had not used it the blessed child would have what a fortunate escape why i wouldnt have a child of mine and fresh in the little thing would have been such a wonderful world i never thought of it before but it is lucky that john could leave me out to art i can stand it so much easier than waiting i swear but of course i never mentioned it to anyone im too honest but i keep watching about all this and you know if things in that paper then nobody knows who i am or who i am im an outside credit and i do sheep with the deer every day i always the same sheep only very mean ones and it is lucky in the only one sticking down and peaking about the honey thats patting i dont like the bits i wonder if theyre going to paint i wish john would take me away from here it was so hard to talk with john about my case but the case here is so wise and the case he was in so but i tried to master it it was new young the moon shines in all around the city sun i cant see it sometimes but its still a little slow and it always comes around me but its not a matter john left the city and i hid it to wait for him so i kept stealing and watched him leave me and id never be ready to wear a coat until i felt the pain the fate figured my kind of scene to shake the pattern and i just as wish he wanted to get out i got up softly and looked at the field and see if the paper didnt leave me and when i came back john was awake what is it little girl he said dont feel walking about what that youll get pulled i thought it was a good time to talk so i told him that i really was not deeming him and i wished he would take me away why darling said he the police will be up in three weeks and i cant see how to leave before there are fears in my finished home and i cannot possibly leave town just now of course if you were in any danger i could and would but you really are a better deer whether you can see it or not i am a doctor dear and i know youre getting flesh and color your appetite is better and i felt a little much easier about you i dont wear a bit more said i nor as much and my appetite may be better in the evening when you are here but it is worse in the morning when you are away the last whole little farm said he would be great great fun she shall be as supersheepfree as it is but now lets improve the shining hours by going to sleep dont talk about it in the morning and you wont go away i ask only why how can i dear it is only three weeks more and then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while ginny is getting the house ready really dear you are better better in body perhaps i beg your pardon ill stop short but very set up straight and looked at me with such a stern refreshed look that i could not say another word my darling said he i beg your neither for my sake and for our childs sake as well as for your own that you will never for one instant let that idea into your mind there is nothing so dangerous so fascinating to a temperament like yours it is a false and foolish fantasy can you not trust me as a physician whom i tell you so so of course i said no more my score and we went to sleep for four long he thought i was asleep first but i wasnt and lay there for hours trying to decide whether that blood pattern and that intact pattern really did move together or separately on a pattern like this by daylight there is a lack of sequence a defiance of law there is a constant irritant to a normal mind but color is hideous enough and unreliable enough and infuriating enough that the pattern is torturing you think youre mastered it but just as soon as you get well under reinfulging it turns a back somersault in there you are it slaps you in the face knocks you down and cramples a plane this is like a bad dream the outside pattern is a fluid hervest reminding one of a fungus if you can imagine a toadstool in joints an interminable string of toadstools thudding scouting and endless convolutions why that is something like it that is sometimes there is one market peculiarity about this paper a thing nobody seems to notice to myself and that is that it changes as the light changes when the sun shoots in through the east window i always watch that first long straight moon it changes so quickly that i never can quite believe it that is why i watch it every minute by moonlight the moon shines in all night when there is a moon i wouldnt know it was the same paper at night in any kind of light then twilight candlelight lamp light and worst of all by moonlight it becomes blars the outside pattern i mean and the woman behind it is as plain as can be i didnt realize for a long time if the thing was that showed behind that dim subtime but now i am quite sure it is alone by daylight she is subdued but that fancy is the pattern the future shows still it is so puzzling they keep sneakby by the hour i lie down ever so much and the time is as if it was written and to sleep all i can indeed each door is ahead of me and the thing you lie down for an hour and a half it is a very bad pattern i have to list but you see i dont see it and that cultivates the seat but i dont tell them on a rate oh no but after that i hear a little prayer from you it seems very clear to me that even you have an inch of paper there it strikes me i tell you but thats not a sign of stupidity but thats not stupidity i do not know if you know what im doing because you suddenly are looking for solutions not for the silvertimes youre looking at the paper and ginny too brought ginny with her hand on her face she didnt know what to do and you always try to tell her but shes very good but it must be spreading in your puzzle what she was doing with the paper she turned around and said she had been touched by a spirit and it frightened me thats the reason why i should threaten myself then she said paper stains everything it talks and she found no excuses and no life for it was in your hands i see this from you and youre perfect did not that sound innocent but i am not studying at all i am telling you nobody should find out about myself life is so very much more exciting than history this is even a selfignored thing i would call it the end of the world but i will be there and im not quiet in my words the darkness is so sweet to see in pain you have to go the other day and so i see deep voice and i say i dont know about people i tell you all the time i had no reason to tell him it was because of the law and paper he had made fun of me he might even want to take me away i dont want to leave him until ive found it out there is a week more and i think that would be enough that feeling ever so much better i dont sleep much at night but it is so interesting when you watch the movies but i sleep a good deal in the daytime in the daytime its a nice and neat place there are always new sheets on the phones and new shades of yellow all over it i cannot keep counting them you are outside conscientious it is the strangest yellow of that law people nice and big of all the yellow things i ever saw beautiful ones like butter the old and the old bad and the old if theres something else about that people the smell i noticed it the moment we came into the room there was so much fear and silence not fear now we have found a beat of fog and rain and part of the windows are open and knocked and the smell is still here it creeps all over the house i find it cozy in the dining room stulting in the hall frightened in the hug blind and weakling on the stairs its in my head even though i did a lot i felt my head suddenly in surprises there is that smell such a peculiar odor too i spent hours in the corner of the hall discovering what it smelled like it is not bad at first and very gentle but quite the subtlest most enduring odor ive ever met in this damp weather it is awful i wake up in the night and find it hanging over me it used to destroy me at first i thought seriously of burning the house to reach the smell but now im used to it the only thing i can think of is that it is like the color of the paper a yellow smell theres a very funny mouth on this one you lower down and clear the mouthboard a street ranger and ranger it goes between every piece of furniture except the bed a long straight even smorch as if it had been rubbed over and over i wonder how it was done who did it and what they did it for round and round and round round and round and round it makes me dizzy ive really had to scubbish some people out through work and so much of it when i changed the center i finally found it out the front fatter does move and i wonder the woman behind shakes it sometimes i think there are great many women behind and sometimes only one and she calls her out fast and her crawling shakes it all over then in the very bright stars shell keep still and in the very shady spots if she gets hit full of the bars they shake them hard and shes all the time trying to climb through but nobody could climb through that tower explain with so i think that is quite theres so many heads they get through and in the pan strangles them off and turns them upside down and makes their eyes fight those heads were covered with taking off and they never got so mad i think that woman gets out in the daytime and ill tell you what ive seen her i can see her out of every one of the windows it is the same woman i know where she is always creeping and most lonely doing not creep by daylights i see her on that long road and her trees creeping around and her curious parts she hides under the blackbirded mountains i dont blame her bits they must be very humiliating to be creeping by daylights well so more of a creep by daylights but the other day night there was a child with a sex on their lawns and john is so peering now that i dont want to irritate them i wish she would take another ring besides i dont want anybody to get that woman out at night but myself i hope to wonder if i could see her out of all the windows at once it plays as fast as i can i can only see out of one at a time and though i always see her she may be able to fit faster than i can turn ive watched her sometimes away all through the open country creeping as fast as a cloud shadow in a high wound if only that tough habit could be gotten off from the end of one i mean to try it little by little ive found out another funny thing that i shot teller at this time it was not even the trustee of the watch there are only two more days to pick this paper up and i believe john is beginning to notice i dont like to look in his eyes and i heard you ask ginny a lot of professional questions about him she had a very good report to give she said i slept a good deal in the daytime john knows i dont sleep very well at night but while im so quiet i actually also took a fish tank to school and put the camera to be very lovely in the time that is if i could see through him still i dont wonder if you asked me to sleep in any of this paper for three nights im just interested in it but i feel sure john and ginny are secretly affected by it hooray this is the last day but it is enough john is to stay in town overnight and hell be out until this evening does anyone need to sleep with me with a slob you know but i told her i should endavably rest better for a night all alone that was clever but i really wasnt alone with her as soon as it was a new one and a failed thing began to fall and shape the pattern i got up and ran to help her and i thought if she was sure i should when she pulled and before morning hed killed all the years of the paper i stripped about a small as many thin and half around the room and then when the sun came and the awful pattern began to laugh at me i declared i would finish it today we go away tomorrow and there all moving all my friends would down again to read things as they were to do ginny looked at the long amazement but thats all her narrowing about to do a pure spite of the vicious thing she laughed and said she wouldnt mind doing it herself but i must not be tired i should be tired of something but i am and no person touches this paper but me not alone she tried to get me out of the room but it was too painful but i said it was so quiet and i didnt think and i believed out of my belly and id sleep all i could and not to wake me even for a bit i was so tired and now shes gone and so is gone and things are gone and theres nothing left but a great bedstead in a old bed and im going to tell you this now in time shes asleep and now hes still in his room and taking a bedstead in his room and what is your room you know where it is huh well theres no big room back here theres a bedstead thats been long and i said and what do you want to do i dont want to go and what do you want to do anybody come here and theyre coming and i said and there were a couple of people and they didnt see me and theyre coming and that woman does get out and tries to get away and it gets in the way of her but i forgot i couldnt reach her and i didnt need anything to stand on this bed will not move i tried to lift and push it until i was laying and then i got so angry i bit off a little piece of my finger but it hurt my teeth they are pure off all the paper i could make standing on the floor it sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it all those strangled heads and bulbous eyes and jubbly fungusbursts just shriek with vision im getting angry enough to be something desperate i thought that the window would be an admirable exercise but the bar was too strong and had a problem besides i was angry but of course not i knew well enough this step like that is damn thoughtproviding like i didnt miss a screw i dont like to even look out of the windows there are so many of us creeping in and they creep so fast i wonder if it all came out of that door if they were in there but i am still very fast in the middle but my will didnt work you dont get in media from the way youre there i suppose i should have had that plan in mind on night and that is poor it is so pleasant to be out in this great way and i think around these like things i dont want to go inside i wont even if jean asks me to outside you have to think on the ground and everything is raining instead of the weather but if you dont think on the ground and my shoulder just fits me that noise you dont know so i dont need to know why theres a door at the door theres no use running there you cant get out of here no you dont its fine you know its crying for a minute therell be a shame to break down that beautiful door so im here said i named jeans voice the key is down by the front steps im here crying for a minute thats all i was telling you about what do you say what do you say what do you do what cant you say the key is down by the front door and youre crying for a minute and then i said it again so what time i really didnt even mean to slow you you said it so well and you had to go to the sea and he got it of course and came home hes not short on the word what is the motor if you try good gods sake what are you doing i kept on thinking just to see but i looked at him over my shoulder i got out at last said i in spite of you and ginny and i pulled off most of the paper so you cant take me back now boy i should have been there in a faint of it but he did and ran across my path by the wall so that i had to creep over him every time then though the yola bit me i tried to think of you you thought of me telling me tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me
