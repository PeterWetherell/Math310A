 this is a little bit of a trip for you i hope you are watching this video for more information or to volunteer please visit wwwlibrivalesorg according to the following law wwwmyspacematuredefinite the yellow wall of the building is a charlottepresentee it is very seldom in here ordinary people like john and myself such as your ancestral hall which i will show you this is a colonial mansion a hereditary estate i would say a haunted house and meets the height of a manic felicity but that would be asking too much of fate still i would proudly declare that there is something fear about it else why else should it be left so cheaply and why have stilts along intimidated john lafse from their place but one expects that in marriage john is practical and extreme he has no patience with faith an intense horror of superstition and he scoffs openly at any talk of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures john is a physician and perhaps i would not say to a living soul of course but this is dead paper and a great relief to my mind perhaps that is one reason i did not get well faster you see he does not believe i am sick in what came under him a physician and highstreet and ones own husband assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing to matter with one but temporary nervous depression a slight hysteria and tendency what is one to be my brother is also a physician and also an icecreamer and he says the same thing do i take phosphates or phosphides whichever it is antonics and journeys and air and exercise and an absolutely forbidden to work until i am well again personally i disagree with their ideas personally i believe in a continuum with excitement and change and a domegold with what is one to do i did write for a while in spite of them but it does exhaust me of them putting this aside it helps me with my condition i sometimes fancy that my condition if i had less opposition and more society and stimulus but john says the very worst thing i can do is think about my condition and i confess it always makes me feel bad so i will let it alone and talk about the house the most beautiful place it is quite alone standing well back from the road quite three miles from the village it makes me think of english places that you read about where there are hedges and walls and dates that lock and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people there is a delicious garden i never saw such a garden large and shady full of boxboarded paths and lined with long redcolored arbezz with seats under them there were greenhouses too but they are all broken now there was some legal trouble i believe something about the hares and cohairs anything that places a painting for years that spoils my dorsaliness im afraid but i dont care there is something strange about the house i can feel it i even said so to john he said what i felt was a drop i get unreasonable angry with john sometimes im sure i never used to be so sensitive i think it is due to this nervous condition but john says if i feel so i shall neglect proper selfcontrol so i take pains to control myself before him at least and that makes me very tired i dont like our room but this i want to run downstairs and open on the piano side and have roses all over the window in such pretty oldfashioned chipped paintings with john with hot feathers this shop was kind of a oneroom but not a room for two girls and no mere room for them if it took another i was very careful of nothing and hardly let my spirit pass special directions im a severe prescription for each power on the road he takes all care from me and so i feel basically unwaitful not to value him he said he came here so realnight if i was to have perfect rest and all the air i could get your exercise depends on your strength my dear said he and your food somewhat on your appetite but air you can absorb all the time so we took the nursery at the top of the house it is a big airy room the whole floor in here with windows that look all waves and air and sunshine below it was nursery first and then playroom and gymnasium i should judge where the windows are barred from the little children and there are reams of things in the walls the paint on paper looked as if a boys school had used it it is stripped off the paper in great patches all around the head of my bed about as far as i could reach and in a great place on both sides of the room i never saw a vertical line and a sprawling flamboyant pattern committing every artistic scene as the dull enough to confuse the eye of the father announced enough to constantly irritate and provoke study and when you follow the lame uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit suicide plunge off at outrageous angles destroy themselves and unheard of contradictions the color is repellent armors revolting a smoldering unclean mellow strangely faded by the slow tingly sunroof it is a dull yet unruly harmony of some places sickly selfretent knows no wonder the children hated it i should hate it myself if i had to live in this room long there comes john unless we could just hear the new weeks current write a word weve been here two years we havent felt this right since that first year im sitting by the window now up in this atrocious nursery and theres nothing to hinder my writing as much as i please i say black and strong john is away all day and even some nights when his faces are serious im glad my face is not serious but these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing john does not know how much i really suffer he knows there is no reason to suffer and that satisfies him of course it is only nervousness it does weigh on me so not to do my duty in any way i meant to be such a help to john such a real rest and comfort and here i am a comparative burden already no one would believe what an effort it would take to deal with a little iaadress and entertainer and other things it is fortunate mary is so good with the baby such a dear baby and yet i cannot deal with him makes me so nervous i suppose john was never nervous in his life he laughs at me so about this wallpaper at first he meant to repaper the room but afterwards he said that i was letting it get the better of me and that nothing is worse for a nervous patient than to give way to such funsays and he said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy bedspread and then the barred windows and then the gate ahead of the stairs and so on you know the place is doing you good you see and really dear i dont care to renovate the house just for a threemonths rental then do let us go down the stairs there are such pretty women there then he took me in his house and called me a blessed little goose and said he would go down to the south and have a bright bright stage of life but he is not here he is in the house he is in the house he is standing around here he comes and he is walking but he will not be a safe place he will not be a safe place he really didnt fight the farm he fought the farm at one point like this there was mysterious addition to the farm there was a big addition to the farm and there was a big addition to the farm i have a note that in the ugly view of the road in a little private court belonging to the estate there is a beautiful shaded room with a rosebed view of the house i always fancy a steep walking and numerous paths and corridors but john is cautioned not to be rude and offensive he said i am not a gentle person i am not a historian i know this weakness but not i am sure to know that all men are kind of subtle princesses and that i ought to be kind of a princess i am a gentle person so ill tell you i think sometimes if i were only willing to write i would leave the press for ideas and lessons but i find i would be pretty tired from the time i was so discouraged not to have any advice and companionship about my work when i get really well john says he will ask president finlay and julia to come for a long visit he says he will assume he could fire words in my pillowcase as to let me have those stimulating people i dont know i wish i could go fast but i must not think about that this paper looks to me as if it knew what a vicious confidant is there is a recurrent spot where i have any words on the broken record the true bird is tired of scourging for so long i get positively angry with the impertinent others and the everlastingness up and down in the sideways they call and those absurd ungrieving eyes are everywhere there is one little place for two breaths that will match and the eyes go all up and down the line and one more little tired than the other we have a sauce on which expression in the air and we all know how much expression in the air we use the wide wings of the child and get no more into a team than the terrible the wonderful wonderful and the wonderful things the most children are no more to us from the world i remember a kinder link in lives about a good old year in the start and we are at one time all the same strong and proud and we used to be a couple we never had a bunch of bunch of people and we were called to stop in the dungeon and do the same the furniture in this room is more worse than in our menu this time but we had to bring it all up and down in the stairs i suppose when this was used as a playroom we had to take the nursery things out and no wonder i never saw such ravages as the childrens have made here the wallpaper that i sit before is torn off in spots and its sticking close to my brother and i say mr williams whats the matter with you im going to destroy you im going to destroy you im going to destroy you im going to destroy you im going to destroy you im going to destroy you im going to destroy you there comes down a sister such a dear girl she is and so carefully i must not find a fight with her she is a perfect and a piece of her stethoscope and yet with no better proficiency i believe in her she thinks it is the right thing to do with her but i can write what she is saying ive been using her long enough to do this theres one thing that is better i love this shape of her i know that she is hot shes hot there she is shes pretty shes dia ste she is from the還زа no point in telling her that she knows and i do believe in her from the outside from the bella pat it seems to scope it out i can see it theres sister on the stairs well the 4th of july is over the people are gone and lying the entire house john thought he might do it but its a little company so he just had mother and son and children lying for the night of course i have been in the corner of the gym this whole time but at the time john said that he was afraid to go to the gym he was just afraid to wear a uniform and follow me i had a friend who was with us come in john and she says he was just like john and my brother only more or less he says he has such an image of what hes called i dont feel as if it was worth it i turn my hand over from anything im getting a grip from the front of the car i have not seen the car this time of course i dont see john nobody else i dont know if ive ever seen him i dont know if ive ever seen him john is talking to me very often to see his kids and john is good he lets me know when im about to go so i walk in a little new car im in a little new car i sit on the porch and move the wheels i sit on my own car im in a little new car im in spite of that im not supposed to drive it as well as in my mind so im in a very unmovable car im in a little car and follow that pattern that ive got to follow it is as good as gymnastics i assure you i start ill say at the bottom down in the corner over there where it has not been touched and i determine for the thousandth time that i will follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a conclusion i know a little of the principle of design and i know this thing is not arranged on any laws of radiation or alternation or repetition or symmetry or anything else that ive ever heard of it is repeated of course by the breads but not other breads looked at in one way each bret stands alone the bloated curves and flourishes a kind of debased romanesque with delirium trimmings go waddling up and down in isolated columns of fertility but on the other hand they connect diagonally and the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror like a lot of wallowing seaweeds in full chase the whole thing goes horizontally too at least it seems so i exhaust myself and try to distinguish the order thats going in that direction theyve used a horizontal breadth for a freeze and that adds wonderfully to the confusion there is one end of the room where it is almost intact and there when the crosslights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it i can almost fancy radiation after all the interminable grotesques seem to form around the common center and rush off in a headlong plunge of peoples destruction it makes no time to follow it i will take a nap i guess i dont know why i should write this i dont want to i dont feel able and i know john that they could have served but i must say what i feel and think in some way it is such a relief and it never seems to be greater than half the time that i am offered a ride down ever so much john says i mustnt lose my strength and he has me take cod liver oil and lots of tonics and things to say nothing of ale and wine in rare meat dear john he loves me dearly and hates to have me sick i tried to have a real earnest reason to talk with him the other day and tell him how i wish he would let me go and make a visit to cousin henry and julia but he said i wasnt able to go nor able to stand it after i got there and i did not make out a very good case for myself for i was crying before i had finished it is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight just this nervous weakness i suppose and dear john gathered me up in his arms and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed and sat by me and read to me until it tired my head he said i wish his darling and his comfort in all he had and that i must take care of myself for his sake and keep well he says no one but myself can help me out of it that i must use my will and selfcontrol and not let any silly fancies run away with me theres one comfort the baby is well and happy and does not have to occupy this nursery with a horrid wallpaper if we had not used it the blessed child would have what a fortune and escape why i wouldnt have a child of mine an impressionable little thing living such a room for worlds i never thought of it before but it is lucky that john kept me here after all i can stand it so much easier than a baby you see of course i never mention it to anyone i am too wise but i keep watching what i ever say there are things in that paper that nobody knows but me or ever will behind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day its always the same shape only very new then it is likely one of you sticking down and cranking about behind that pattern i dont like it a bit i wonder how theyre going to think i wish john would take me away from here its so hard to talk to john about my case because he was so wise and because he loves me so but i tried it last night it was moonlight the moon shines in all around just as the sun does i hate to see it sometimes it feels so slow it always comes in about one window and another one john was asleep and i hid it to wake him up so i kept still and watched the moonlight and that insulating wall of people till i felt the people the fate for you behind it seemed to shape the pattern just as if she wanted to pass i got up softly and looked at you you see the paper didnt move and when i came back john was awake what is it little girl he said dont go walking about like that youll get cold i thought it was a good time to talk so i told him that i really was not gaining in the wish he would take me away why darling our lease will be up in three weeks and i cant see how to leave before the repairs are not done at home and i cannot possibly leave town just now of course if you were in any danger i could and would but you really are a better deer whether you can see it or not i am a doctor deer and i know that you are gaining flesh and color your appetite is better i thought it was much easier about you i dont wear a bit more said i nor as much and my appetite may be better in the evening when you are here but it is worse in the morning when you are away bless her little heart said he with a great big hug she shall be as sick as she pleases but now lets improve the shining hours by going to sleep and talk about it in the morning and you wont go away i ask why how can i dear it is only three weeks more and then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while ginny is getting the house ready really dear you are better better in body perhaps i began and stopped short for he sat up straight and looked at me with such a stern reproachful look that i could not say another word my darling said he i beg of you for my sake and for our childs sake as well as for your own that you will never for one instant let that idea into your mind there is nothing so dangerous so fascinating to a temperament like yours it is a false and foolish fancy can you not trust me as a physician when i tell you so so of course i said no more on that score and we went to sleep before the night he thought i was asleep first but i wasnt and lay there for hours trying to decide whether that front pattern and that back pattern really did move together or separately on a pattern like this like daylight there is a lack of sequence a defiance of law that is a constant irritant to a normal mind where color is hideous enough and unreliable enough and infuriating enough with the patterns torturing you think you have mastered it but just as soon as you get well underway in following it turns up back somersault and there you are it slaps you in the face knocks you down and tramples upon you this is like a bad dream the outside pattern is a florid arabesque reminding one of a funless if you can imagine a toadstool in joints an interminable stream of toadstools budding and scouting in endless convolutions why that is something like it that is sometimes there is one mark of a familiar and outofthesouth but there are no others who are similar to this and that is what changes as the art changes when the sun shoots in for a first window i always watch that first long straight rain it changes so quickly that i never can quite believe it that is why i watch it all in this by moonlight the moon shines in all night when there is a moon i wouldnt know it was the same paper at night in any kind of light in twilight candlelight lamp light and worst of all by moonlight it becomes bars of the outside pattern im in and the woman behind it has as plain as can be i didnt realize for a long time what the thing was that showed behind that dim subpattern but now i am quite sure it is a woman by daylight she has subdued quiet i fancy that its the pattern that keeps her so still it is so pleasant it keeps me quiet by the hour i lie down ever so much and john says it is good for me and to sleep all i can he started to have it by making me lie down for an hour to each man it is a very bad habit i am convinced for you see i dont sleep and that cultivates deceit for i dont tell them im awake oh no the fact is im getting a little afraid of john he seems very queer sometimes and even ginny has an inexplicable look it strikes me occasionally just as a scientific hypothesis that perhaps it is the paper i have watched john when he did not know i was looking and come into the room suddenly on the most innocent excuses and ive caught him several times looking at the paper and ginny too i caught ginny with her hand on it once she didnt know i was in the room and then i asked her she was doing the paper she turned around as if she had been caught stealing and looked quite angry asking me why i should frighten her so then she said if the paper stained everything it touched she had found yellow speaches on all my clothes and jobs and she wished for me to be more careful with my actions and she said i was in johns and she wished for me to be more careful with my acts as an innocent but i know she was studying that pattern and i am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself life is so very much more exciting now than it used to be you see i have something more to expect to look forward to to watch i will do better and im more quiet than i was john is so pleased to see me agree he laughed a little the other day he said i seemed very close and he spied up my wallpaper i turned off the wallpaper i have no intention of telling him it was because of the wallpaper he would make fun of me he might even want to take me away i dont want to leave now until i have found it out there is a week more and i think that would be enough im feeling ever so much better i dont see much at night where it is so interesting to watch developments but i see the good deal in the daytime and the daytime is just tiresome and fullfledged there are always new sheets on the fungus and new shades of yellow all the months i cannot keep count of it i try to be conscientious but it is a stranger to know about all of it it makes me think of all the yellow things i ever saw the nonbeautiful ones are the other things the old the bad the bad the bad ones theres something else about me the smell i noticed that the moment it came into the room there was so much air and sun that it was not bright now we have had a week of bothering me and whether the windows are open or not the smell is still here i find it troubling in the dining room sculpting in the corridor hiding in the hall crying and waiting on the stairs it gets in and out of here even when i go to ride if i turn my head suddenly and surprise it there is that smell such a peculiar odor too i have spent hours in trying to analyze it to find what it smelled like it is not bad at first and very gentle to quite the subtlest most enduring odor ive ever met and this damp weather is awful i wake up in the night and find it moving over me im used to disturbing at first i thought seriously burning the house to reach the smell but now im used to it the only thing i can think of is that it is like the color of the paper a yellow smell theres a very plain mark on this one i go around i go around i go straight down the round road it goes behind every piece of furniture its up to there long straight even smooch as if it had been rubbed way way before i wonder how it was done if it did it and what they did it for round and round and round round and round and round it makes me dizzy i really have discovered something about this through watching so much at night when it changes so i finally found it out the foot pattern does move and no wonder the woman behind shakes it sometimes i think there are great many women behind and sometimes only one but she calls around fast and her phone shakes it all over then in very bright spots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard and shes all the time trying to turn through but nobody can climb through that pattern and stream this out i think that is why it has so many heads they get through and then the pattern strangles them all and turns them upside down and makes their eyes pop out those heads are covered theyre taken off theyre not like lost in the world i think that woman gets out of the data and i tell you what ive seen her i can see her at every one of the windows it is the same woman i know for she is always creeping and most women do not creep by daylight i see her on that long road under the trees creeping along and when a carriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines i dont blame her a bit it must be very humiliating to be caught creeping by daylight im always locked the door when i creep by daylight i cant do it at night for i know john would suspect something at once and john is so queer now that i dont want to irritate him i wish he would take another woman but i dont want anybody to get that woman i dont want anybody to get that woman i dont want anybody to get that woman i dont want anybody to get that woman i turn as fast as i can i can only see at every one of the times im not a far away seeker she may be able to creep faster than i can turn i have watched her sometimes away off in the open country creeping as fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind ive only that top pattern could have gotten off from the under i mean to try it little by little i have found out another funny thing but i shant tell it at this time it does not do the trust people too much there are only two more ways to get this people off of you and i believe john is beginning to believe you i dont want you looking at me and ive heard him this day a lot of professional questions about me she had a very good report to give she said i snuck the beautiful woman john hilt i see her as a woman you all are so quiet he asked me all sorts of questions too i pretend that im very loving and kind as if i couldnt see through him still dont wonder he acts so sleeping under this paper for three months it only interests me but i feel sure john and jim are secretly affected by it hurrah this is the last day but it is enough john is to stay in town overnight and wont be out until this evening jimmy wanted to sleep with me this little thing but i told her i should undoubtedly rest better for a night all alone that was clever but i really wasnt alone a bit as soon as it was moonlight and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern i got up and ran to help her i pulled and she shook i shook and she pulled and before morning we had peeled off yards of the paper a strip about as high as my head and half around the room and then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me i declared i would finish it today we go away tomorrow and theyre all moving all my furniture down and do many things as they were before jimmy looked at the wall in amazement but i told her merrily that i did it at a pure spite at the vicious thing she laughed and said she wouldnt mind doing it herself but i must not get tired how she betrayed herself that time but i am here and no person touches this paper but me not alive she tried to get me out of the room that was too bad but i said it was so quiet and empty and clean now that i believed i would lie down again and sleep all i could and not to wake me even for dinner i would call when i woke up so now she is gone and the servants are gone and the things are gone and there is nothing left that great bedstead nailed down into the canvas mattress we found on this paper we shall sleep downstairs tonight and take the boat home tomorrow i quite enjoyed the room how those children did tear about here this bedstead is fairly gnawed but i am a skip to work i have locked the door and thrown the key down into the compact i dont want to go out and i dont want to have anybody come in until john comes i want to go astonished ive got a rope here that even ginny did not find if that woman does get out and tries to get away i can tie her but i forgot i could not reach far without anything to stand on this bed will not move i tried to lift and push it until i was lame and then i got so angry i bit off a little piece in one corner but it hurt my teeth then i peeled off all the paper i could reach standing on the floor it sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it all those strangled heads and bulbous eyes and waddling feet those strangled heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with derision im getting angry enough to do something desperate to jump out of the window with the admirable exercise the bars are too strong even to try besides i wouldnt do it of course not i know well enough that a step like that is improper and might be misconstrued i dont like to even look out of the windows there are so many of those creeping women and they creep so fast i wonder if they all came out of that wallpaper as i did but i am securely fastened now by my wellhidden rope you dont get me out in the road there i suppose i shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes night and that is hard it is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as i please i dont want to go outside i wont even if jenny asked me to for outside you have to creep on the ground and everything is green instead of yellow but here i can creep smoothly on the floor and my shoulder just fits into that long smootch around the wall so i cannot lose my way why theres john at the door its no you young man you cant open it how he does call and pound now hes crying for an axe it would be a shame to break down that beautiful door john dear said i in the gentlest voice the key is down by the front steps under a plantain leaf that silence told him for a few moments then he said very quietly indeed open the door my darling i cant said i the key is down by the front door under a plantain leaf and then i said it again several times very gently and slowly and said it so often that he had to go and see and he got it of course and came in he stopped short by the door what is the matter he cried for gods sake what are you doing i kept on creeping just the same but i looked at him over my shoulder ive got out at last said i in spite of you and ginny and ive pulled off most of the paper so you cant put me back now why should the man have fainted but he did and ran across my path by the wall so that i had to creep over him every time end of the yellow wallpaper by charlotte perkins gilliman recorded by alan noble thomasville
