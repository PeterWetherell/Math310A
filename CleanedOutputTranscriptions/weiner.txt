bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the little bit of a little bit here this thing this is more than like angels sighing thru his cooking skills but but that would be asking too much of fate still a crowd will declare a second full of eyes thats why i ought to show you that so cheaply and why the streets are long and timidly who join the last secret place but more than expect that in marriage john is practical in his dream he has no patience with faith and in tense horror superstition and hes got openly at any top of his things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures john is a physician and perhaps i would not say to a living soul of course but this is dead paper and a great relief to my mind perhaps that is one reason i did not get well faster and you see he does not believe i am sick and what can i do but the physician and the eyes seem to be a little bit more but she is free and lulligated but there is really nothing in that of it but temporarily nervous depression a slight disturbed opportunity what is going to be my brother is also a physician and i am also a highstudent and he says the same thing hes a very thick phosphate for whichever he is in thomas in journeys in a exercise and in absolutely needful good in each others work in surviving well in a person and just a real miracle i do it personally i believe in a continual way but excitement and change in a doing new world what is what is going to do i did write for a while inspired for you but it does you draw to me and you do this as a slider and thats what im doing i sometimes fancy that my condition if i had less opposition and more society and stimulus the john says the very worst thing i can do is think about my condition and i confess that always makes me feel bad so i will let it alone and talk about the house the most beautiful place is that it is quite alone standing well back from the road quite three miles from the village and makes me think of english places that you read about but there are hedges and walls and dikes that walk and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people there is a delicious garden and never saw such a garden large and shady full of boxboughted paths and lime with long bluecovered artbased receipts under them there are green houses too but they are all broken now there was some legal trouble but something about the hills and hills or any of them the place found in few years that spoils my goslee in this sign for me but i dont care theres something strange about this i can feel it i even said so to john and he said what i cant do is a dropin sign i cant do it i cant do it i cant do it john said im sure i never used to do this since then i think it is due to his nervous condition but john said if i feel so i should neglect proper selfcontrol so i take things to control this before him and that makes me curious i dont know why i found you in the case i want to learn about this here because i cant learn anything about it ive heard this all over the world its such a good thing johns got to learn he said i know hes not here hes just here i know youre here for fun take another hes here hes here for another hes having that same spirit thats such a great experience im just a subject to speaking hes crying he takes all of care for me just an after youre patient im afraid im not allowed to he said if youre so young if i was to have a perfect rest and all the air i could get your exercise depends on your strength my fear said you and your food somewhat on your appetite but ever you can absorb all the time so we took the nursery at the top of the house it is a big airing the whole foreign air with windows that look all the way and air and sunshine glow it was nursery first and then play room and imagination i should judge but the windows are body and wood children and there are means and things of the walls the people and people look as if a boys school had used it it is stripped off the paper in great patches all around the head of my bed about as far as i can i never saw a wood school you know the sky flame fire and having a pretty every artistic side the whole earth is a dream the world has to constantly irritate and provoke study and when you follow the main uncertain curves the view of distance they suddenly commit suicide plunge off at outrageous angles destroy themselves and then herd of contradictions the colour is repelent all those who go to a small room uncliminal room the school must be faded by the sea a lot of sun i dont know i dont know the world is on places sickly soaked with tent notes no wonder the children painted it i should hate it myself i had to live in this room long there comes joy i must have a visit i dont even know right away weve been here for a while ive been here for a while i dont know what youre saying hes living by the window ive been a staccraceous and merciless man ive been in my mind lots of that money i want to say black and stroke john is away all day hes leaving some mercy on his face and im glad in my face of my choice hes nervous towards a large refreshing way john does not know how much i really suffered he knows there is no reason to suffer but not satisfied sir of course it was only nervousness it does weigh on me so not to do my duty in any way i meant to be such a hope to john such a real rest and comfort but here i am a comparative burden already no one would believe what an end of the world is i think thats a great way to get my duty i meant to do it another thing is that it is fortunate mary is so good for me such a dear mary and yet i cannot see her he makes me so nervous i suppose john is never in my business like this he left me so like ive just walked out of it but of course he meant to be a hope to go in the court but afterwards he said that i was letting it get the better of me and that nothing in his works or in more despishable to him he didnt give away such choices they said that after the law finished his children he didnt give him a gift and then he found when he left his home and then he gave up but never the spirit of his son you know the place is doing your good and really do it i dont care to renovate the house just for a 31 screen to me you do that as you go down there are such things i need to write then you took me in his house and called me a plus of you he said you would be going to say but i thought he had a crush on me but he was laughing he was like im not going to say anything im not going to say anything im not going to say anything im not going to say anything im not going to say anything im not going to say anything im not going to say anything im not going to say anything im not going to say anything im not going to say anything im not going to say anything im not going to say anything im not going to say anything im not going to say anything im not going

know this week is like my school time im going to say something im going to lie to you im going to lie to you i think sometimes i will call you back but you really have the first idea to ask me but i found it in the kitchen time and its so just filled im not going to let you go im going to lie to you im going to lie to you can i get really well john said he has nothing to do with me im going to lie in this kitchen he says he really suits the fire thats not the truth i still let me have very stimulating people out here im going to lie to you im going to lie to you but i must not think about that so lets keep it i think thats the truth i think thats the truth i think thats the truth i think thats the truth i think thats the truth i think thats the truth i think thats the truth i think thats the truth i think thats the truth i think thats the truth i think thats the truth i think thats the truth i think thats the truth i think thats the truth i think thats where we met each other and the eyes grow all the way down the line and they wear this little fire at the neckup then they just saw something easy przescin dangerous man and we all know how much especially its the五star lighthouse in their town for me legit tv its the heaven there are kids cockroaches the nurse caught the連fia im going to go to the next one im going to go to the next one im going to go to the next one im going to go to the next one im going to go to the next one im going to go to the next one im going to go to the next one im going to go to the next one im going to go to the next one im going to go to the next one im going to go to the next one im going to go to the next one im going to go to the next one im going to go to the next one im going to go to the next one why is it closed when this was used in the car when we had to take the nursing things out and no wonder i never saw such advantages of the childrens at home here the wall here where i sit is torn off in silence and its sticking closed when we were in the car the last one which is a blue and the white and the sea which is a blue this is the first time ive ever seen a girl in the world it looks like a good girl there comes johns sister such a weird little choice and so carefully im listening to her shes a perfect woman to care she could know that she will be rich i know what you do is to relax your sleep but i can write and choose me to be close she would hesitate to let me fall around and i would do better when im awake theres this driving service well the fourth of july is over the people have gone tired out john got my dude to slow him up so he just had another one he showed him that hes almost there hes so tired hes so tired hes so slow hes so tired i hear a friend whos like a scavenger he just says hes just like john on the bed only more so hes like hes such a beautiful guy hes so calm no fear i just want to go im trying to find him yeah im feeling good of course im going to drive im going to drive john is going to drive im going to see his face and too hes good im going to drive im going to drive im going to drive so dont want to push me and i will pass him from the right position self im going to pass him on and follow that calendar all the time it is as good as gymnastics i assure i start and i say at the bottom down in the corner over there where it has not been touched and i determine for the thousandth time that i will follow that rules have them to some sort of conclusion i know a little of a principle of design and i know this thing is not arranged on new laws of radiation or alteration or repetition all so much is anything else that ive ever heard it is written in a book that says but not in a book that says thats written in a book look at in one way each breath stands away the bloated curves and fourishes i kind of debase romanesque with delirium trimmings go waddling up and down in isolated columns of fertility but on the other hand they connect diagonally and the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting ways up to color like a lot of wallowing series in full chase the whole thing goes horizontally too at least it seems so that exhaust must not be in the trimmings the stinger is the order of its goal and direction they have used a horizontal breath for a freeze and that adds one deflated confusion there is one end of the room where it is almost intact and there when the crosslight spade and the loose sun shines directly at the planet i can almost fancy radiation after all the intonable grotesque scene to form around the common scene and rush off in heavy long corners of the vehicles scratch it makes it a time to follow it how will i take it now by this although no virus would write this i dont want it i dont feel able and i know john thinks that im so old but i must i just say that i feel that i cant be sunlight it is such a relief every day every day every day every day every day i have the time i am happy with it and i dont ever see much john says i must take my screen and here is where to take fun of the whole and not take time things to say nothing i am a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man a real man just getting to be a great effort for me to think straight just this nervous weakness i suppose and do you john gathered me up in his arms and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed and sat by me and read to me until it tired my head he said i was his darling i was comforted and all of you had and that i must take care of myself for his sake and keep well he says no one but myself can help me out of it but im asking you how my real and selfcontrol and not let any silly fenceies run away with me theres one comfort but baby is well and happy and does not have to occupy this immersive with a horrible piggy if we had not used it the blessed child would have what a fortune in a scape why i wouldnt have a child of mine an impressionable little thing to live in such a room for worlds i never thought of it before but it is lucky that john kept me here after all i can stand it so much easier than a baby you see of course i never mentioned it to anyone i aint too wise but i keep watching by the same way there are things in that paper and nobody knows for me i have a world behind that outside pattern its all in the same shape only very new its like a woman whos keeping down and clicking about her own pattern i dont like it with this i wonder at the end of the thing i wish john would take me away from here but its so hard to talk to john about my taste because he was so wise because he wasnt so but i tried to lie to him he was here but the new shans and all around just he was seeing that i hope he sees him behind me hes so strong all his comes in by the woman but no one will ever know john was asleep when i headed to waking me so i kept staring and watched the new one and that injury laid in the eye and he took me to my flat if they put you behind your face and shake the pan just if its your own you guys i got up soft and he just said the paper didnt and when i came back john was awake what is it little girl he said dont go walking about like that you get cold i thought it was a good time at all so i told him that i really was not gay nor gay and that i wish to take me away why darling so i at least will be up in three weeks and i cant see how to read before there are players not done at home and i cannot possibly be down this level of course if you were in any danger i could and would but you really are better to read whether you can see it or not im a doctor here i know youre gay and bleached and color the appetite is better i thought it really was much easier about you i thought it was way of 5 more said i more is much and my appetite may be better in the evening when you are here but it is worse in the morning when you are awake bless her little heart said he would a great good hug she shall be a sick as she pleases but now lets include the shining hours by going to sleep ill talk about it in the morning and you wont go away ill just go away why how can i dear it is only three weeks more and then we will take a nice little trip over a few days while jimmy is getting the house ready really dear you are better better in body perhaps ive been in the stop for it chris set up straight and looked at me with such a stern repurchful look that i could not say another word my darling said who id beg of you for my sake and for our childs sake as well as for our own but you will never for one instant let that idea into your mind there is nothing so dangerous so fascinating to a temperament like yours it is a false and foolish fancy can you not trust me as a physician who i tell you so so of course i said no more on that score and we went to sleep for a while i thought i was a sick first and i wasnt sure and later for hours trying to decide whether that foot pattern and that fat pattern really did reach together for suffice on a pattern like this like they might there is a lack of secrets but the finds of law there is a constant irritant to a normal mind the color is hideous enough and unreliable enough and infuriating enough but the patterns to fortune you think you are mastered but just as soon as you get well underway and following it turns up back summersault and there you are it slaps you in the face knocks you down and truncles a punny just like a bad dream the outside patterns are flawed our best reminding one of the funnest if you can imagine a toast to your own joints an internalist in toast to your own but in this pattern in these conditions that is something like it there is some diamonds there is one in the market which i dont know but there is more of a thing to say to this there is some changes as i mentioned in this in the sun she is in the face of the mirror now all these watchers are the first floor and it is great there it changes so quickly that i knew i cant quite believe it that is why i was watching this my mood lights the moon shines in all my memories of me i didnt know what this was in the paper it might be the moon from the light and its far like candlelight and lamp light and worse than all of my moon lights it becomes bars the outside pattern i mean and the woman behind it is this plainness convenient but i didnt realize for a long time the moon was the show behind it that dim sub pattern and now i have quite sure it is a woman but they are actually so do quite i think it is a pattern which is so strong it is so pleasant it keeps me quiet by the hour all i down ever so much while enjoying such a beautiful night i cant just see all i can but he started to have it when im making a lie down when im out of the kitchen it is a very bad habit ive experienced for you see i dont see it and that cultivates the seat if i dont tell them im awake oh no the fact is im getting a little afraid of john he seems very clear sometimes and even jenny has an inexplicable look it strikes me at the occasion just as a scientific hypothesis the perhaps it is the paper i have watched john and he did not know i was looking and come into the room suddenly on the most innocent excuses ive caught him several times looking at the paper and jenny too i caught jenny with her hand on it once she didnt know i was in the room i knew i was trying to cross i knew i was trying to cross the most restraining in the hospital the most serious thing in the paper she turned around so she had been caught stealing and looked quite angry asking me why i should fight myself and then she said the paper stained everything at touch she had done a little smudges on all my clothes and jeans and she was always beautiful with more hot sand pieces but i know shes studying her habit and i am determined that nobody should find out with myself life is so very much more exciting than it used to be you see i have something more to expect to get bored too to watch how will you get me up by the way and im more quiet than what john is so pleased to see me here he worked a lot here again he said i seen him get bored he needs to hide in my wallet i turned off my wallet i have no intention to find him but he has to hide hes not able to lock him he would make fun of him he might even want to take me away i dont want to leave him now until i found him out there is a week more and i think that would be enough im feeling ever so much better if i dont see much of mine but hes so interesting to watch the problems but i see the good thing im not sure and theyre telling me its just ours and whats it were always new shapes on the funnest and new shapes are going to be all the problems i dont like it john do i have time to change this but what is this strange thing about the car and its going to be called the old things i just want to be like i feel like im going to have a car and i dont want to be like that i dont want to be like that and theres something else about it its now cant notice the criminal getting into the room theres so much fear im sorry im not looking at the room its the problem and while the room is open im not its not its going to be im going to tell you its this problem its just over its hard its hard its hard its like im in big crowded places if i turn my head suddenly into prizes there is that smell such a peculiar odor too i have spent hours in trying to analyze it to find what it smelled it is not bad and first and very gentle too quite the sun is the most enduring odor ive ever met and this damp weather was clothed i wake up in the night and find it here over it used to disturb me first i thought seriously i wanted to have a soup to reach the smell but now im used to it the only thing i can think of because that is like the colour of the paper a yellow smell theres a very thing on the screen im just going to sleep and i can go to sleep and i can sleep oh shit you can sleep is it something that youve been wrong youve been hurt i wonder how its done if its late im not very good at this round round round round round round round it makes me dizzy i really have discovered something like that he watches so much at night he changes finally down and out the foot pattern does new and no wonder the woman behind shakes it sometimes i think i have a great meaning behind it sometimes im going to the one but she calls her no fives and her phone shakes it all over and then her voice pops shes still and then her very shame is gone she just takes both of the bars and shakes them hard shes all the time trying to help but nobodys trying to let pattern thats the same thats how many heads they get through and then the pattern the string goes along it turns them upside down and makes it really hard im going to put it in im going to put it in im going to put it in im going to put it in im going to put it in i think that woman did tell you data im not telling you about it ive seen it ive seen it every woman of the windows it is the same woman i know for she is always creeping and most women do not creep by daylight i see her on the wrong road under the trees creeping along and when a carriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines i dont blame her a bit it must be very humiliating in the concrete i think thats it i know its not the door im not going to put it in i cant do it at night for i know john is suspect something was john is so clear now but i dont want to irritate him i wish you would take me there im not going to say that i dont know if i reach out to the woman im not going to say that i cant win i said that i cant win those hands the choice this is i cant i cant say it i cant win its on the line oh its on the line she made the impede thats true then i can turn and watch her sometimes im going to open the open country creeping is anxious ill shadow in my high wind im going to the clock i dont think weve got enough of you in there i need to try it we dont buy you i found out another funny thing but i shot tell it this time its not due to trust pay for too much but i only do it you wont i believe john can be i dont want you to go can i go to this channel why is this question called question she has a very good report to do shes so smart shes so smart oh yeah john youre going to see shes going to see oh its so funny she hasnt gone so shes going to watch you shes going to watch you im going to pretend that youre in the car im going to see you yeah im going to yeah im going to im going to im going to i dont want you to ask im going to get this paper for you im going to enter this small line i like to go to the show im going to show you how to make a perfect line harah this is the last day that it is enough john is to stay in town overnight and well be out until this evening jamie im going to be sick with me its not but i told her i should undoubtedly less feather for a night oh no that was clever but i really wasnt alone a bit as soon as it was moonlight and at four things again to crawl and shake the pattern i got up and ran to help her i pulled and she shook i shook and she pulled and before morning we had peeled off the yards of the paper i stripped about as high as my head and half around the room and then when the sun came and the off of pattern began to laugh at me i declared i would finish it today we go away tomorrow and theyre all moving all my furniture down and time things as they were before jamie looked at the wall in the maze but i told her mary that i get a pure spite of the vicious thing she laughed and said she wouldnt mind doing it herself but i must not get tired how she betrayed herself that time but i am here and no person touches this paper but me not alive she tried to get me out of the room but i said it was so quiet i think you know i would love to leave that little lie down again she didnt call like her im not to wake you even for dinner i would call her when i was a kid so now she is gone and the servants are gone and things are gone and theres nothing left that great dead skin and they all died and theres nothing left thats gone jesus dont say anything ill take you to the room to my wife and daughter im going to the room im going to the room there are some how those children did tear about here this bed still is fairly not but im just going to work i have walked a little and thrown the tree down into the room i dont want to go out and i dont want to have anybody come in so john comes i want to go stung ive got a rope here ive got a rope here ive even jiny did not find if that woman does get out and tries to get away i can tie her but i forgot i could not reach far without anything to stand on this bed will not move i tried to lift and push it until i was lean and then i got so angry i bit off a little piece at one corner but it hurt my teeth then i peel off all the paper i could reach standing on the floor it sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it all those strangled heads and pulled this eyes and waddling fungus gross just shriek with derision im getting angry and up to do something desperate to jump out the window with the admirable exercise the bar is too strong even to try besides i wouldnt do it of course not i know well enough that the step like that is in favor i might aim this instreet i dont like to even look out of the windows there are so many of those creeping women they creep so fast i wonder if they all came out of that wallpaper as i did but i am securely fastened now by my wellpidden rope you dont get me out of the room there thats a close i shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes night and that is hard it is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as i please i dont want to go outside i want even if you dont ask me to frouce side you have to creep on the ground and everything is green instead of yellow but here i can creep smoothly on the floor and my shoulder just fits into that long smoothing around the wall so i cannot lose my way why theres john at the door its no usual man you cant open it how he does call and filmed now hes crying for an axe it would be a shame to break down that beautiful door john dear said i in the ginnless voice the key is down by the front steps under a plantain leaf that sounds tone for a few moments they said very quiet and do open the door my darling i cant say that the key is down by the front door under a plantain leaf and then i said it again several times very gently and slowly and said it so often that he had to go and see and he got it of course and came in and he stopped short by the door what is the matter he cried for gods sake what are you doing i kept on creeping just the same but i looked at him over my shoulder i have got out at last said i in spite of you in gini and ive pulled off most of the paper so you cant put me back now why should the man have fainted what he did and ran across my path by the wall so that i had to creep over him every time i didnt know the yellow wallpaper by charlotte
