 this is a little bit of a trip for you i dont even know what you are doing for more information or to volunteer please visit wwwlibraryorg according to the manual wwwmyspaceimatureunderstoreindefined the yellow wall of the building is charlotte brooklyn state it is very seldom in here ordinary people like john and myself such as your ancestral hall which we will see in a minute a colonial mansion a hereditary estate i would say a haunted house and meets the height of a manic felicity but that would be asking too much of fate still i would proudly declare that there is something fair about it but why else should it be left so cheaply and why has sturz so long intimidated john laughs at me of course but one expects that in marriage john is practical in the extreme he has no patience with faith an intense horror of superstition and he scoffs openly at any talk of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures john is a physician and perhaps i would not say to a living soul of course but this is dead paper and a great relief to my mind perhaps that is one reason i did not get well faster you see he does not believe i am sick in what can only be done a physician and high schooler who wants own husband to show his friends and relatives that there is really nothing to matter with one but temporary nervous depression a slight hysterical tendency what is one to be felt my brother is also a physician and also a high schooler and he says the same thing so i take phosphates or phosphides whichever it is and tonics and journeys and air and exercise and i am absolutely forbidden to work until i am well again personally i disagree with their ideas personally i believe that continual work would excite me and change and would do me good with what is one to do i did write for a while in spite of them but it does exhaust me of what i feel and to do so slightly and else i am forbidden to work until i am well again i sometimes fancy that my condition if i had less opposition and more society and stimulus that john says the very worst thing i can do is think about my condition and i confess it always makes me feel bad so i would let it alone and talk about the house the most beautiful place it is quite alone standing well back from the road quite three miles from the village it makes me think of english places that you read about where there are hedges and walls and gates that lock and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people there is a delicious garden i never saw such a garden large and shady full of boxboarded paths and lime with long gritcolored arbors with seats under them there were greenhouses too but they are all broken now there was some legal trouble i believe something about the hares and cohairs anything that placed a pin for years that spoils my ghostliness im afraid but i dont care there is something strange about the house i can feel it i even said so at the john he said what i felt was a drop at some point im sure i get unreasonable reviews of john sometimes im sure i never used to be so sensitive i think it is due to this nervous conditioning but john says if i feel so i shall neglect proper selfcontrol so i take pains to control myself before him at least and that makes me very tired i dont like our room but its i wanted one downstairs to open on the piano side and had roses all over the room and such pretty oldfashioned chicks peed in the room with john with the spirits this had me as a man one minute and not room for two girls and no near room for them if it took another he is very terrible at loving me and hardly lets me stir up that special direction im just a secret prescription for each color on a day he takes all care from me and so i feel basically unbearable not to value him he said he came here so early on that i was to have perfect rest and all the air i could get your exercise depends on your strength my dear said he and your food somewhat on your appetite but air you can absorb all the time so he took the nursery at the top of the house it is a big airy room the whole floor in the area with windows that look all ways and air and sunshine galore it was nursery first and then playroom and gymnasium i should judge where the windows are barred for little children and there are reams and things in the walls the paint on paper look as if a boys school had used it it is stripped off the paper in great patches all around the head of my bed about as far as i could reach i could hear a great place on the other side of the room i never saw an old pool in the middle of the night and there were sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic scene it is dull enough to confuse the eye of the father but it is pronounced enough to constantly irritate and provoke study and when you follow the lame uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit suicide plunge off at outrageous angles destroy themselves and unheard of contradictions the color is repellent almost revolting a smoldering unclean yellow strangely faded by the slow train of sunflowers it is a dull yet unheard arm of some places sickly selfretent knows no wonder the children hated it i should hate it myself if i had to live in this room long there comes john i must admit this man and he makes him write a word weve been here two years and we havent felt the same right since that first day im sitting by the window now up in this atrocious nursery and theres nothing to hinder my writing as much as i please to save lack of strength john is away all day and even some nights when his faces are serious im glad my face is not serious these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing john does not know how much i really suffer he knows there is no reason to suffer and that satisfies him of course it is only nervousness it does weigh on me so not to do my duty in any way i meant to be such a help to john such a real rest and comfort and here i am a comparative burden already no one would believe what an effort to put his teeth on the little eye of a woman to dress and entertain her and others do this it is fortunate mary is so good with the baby such a dear baby and yet i cannot be with him it makes me so nervous i suppose john was never nervous in his life he laughs at me so about this wallpaper at first he meant to repaper the room but afterwards he said that i was letting it get the better of me and that nothing was worse for a nervous patient than to give way to such fences he said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy bedspread and then the barbed windows and then the gate ahead of the stairs and so on you know the place is doing you good you see and really dear i dont care to renovate the house just for a threemonths rental then do let us go downstairs i guess there are such pretty rooms there then he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose and said he would go down to the cellar and have a bright bright strange life but he is not here he is in prison he is in prison he must have been in a skinandpearlish and in a blackandwhiteish but it might not be the same i dont think im just a little bit of a fool it really is quite fun oh my god how cute how do you know im black as a goose or is mysterious a dish im just a little bit of a freak i wish i could have a nice little choice i dont know but i can be a lovely view of the building in a little private wharf belonging to the estate there is a beautiful shaded room that runs very well from here i always fancy my seatkeep walking in these numerous paths and hours with johns caution not to be blown to the fancy and the sky he says that the modernday church of god will have to store you a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all matters and subtle answers and that i ought to be taught to be a good fit for such a joker team as i am so ill try i think sometimes if i were only willing to write it would relieve the press by doing it in a restaurant but i find id be too tired to be trying it is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my work when i get really well john says we will ask peasant female and jewelrybound for a long visit he says he will as soon as put fireworks in my pillowcase as to let me have those stimulating people out in the night i wish i could go faster but i must not think about that this paper looks to me as if it knew what a vicious conflict it had there is a recurrent spot in the patterned layers of the broken neck between the furthest eye and the stirrer to the side of the neck i get positively angry with the impertinent others and the everlastingness up and down in the sideways they call and those absurd ungrieving eyes are everywhere there is one little place where two breaths dont match and the eyes go all up and down the line and then a little higher than the other we have a sauce of much expression in the middle and we all know how much expression we have and you slide away as a child and get no more attention than that its terrible to have one foot walk and one foot drink and the next children have no choice i remember that i kindly winked at the logs of our big old bureau of the style and looked at the runchart of the outer side of the stronghold i used to think that if any of the alebunds on the two floors were like almost topping the down churn of the dualseated franchuring this room is no worse than in harmony with the style but we had to bring it all up and down the stairs i suppose when this was used as a playroom they had to take the nursery things out and no wonder i never saw such ravages as the childrens have made here the wallpaper that i sit before is torn off in spots and its sticking closer to the ground the master of this room is a little safe and the floor is fractured and damaged and shaked the master of this room is a very heavy bed which is hardly hanging on the ground it looks as if it had been through the walls but i dont know how to answer there comes johns sister such a dear girl she is and so carefully admitted and must not get a fine and whited she is a perfect and bizarre stagast in which were no better professional i believe in her she thinks it is the right image of my sister but i can write what she is and ive been losing my long life for nearly years theres one that comes in this book i love this shape of her and one that just looks like her and two big big names this one is the son of a bitch a particularly irritating one you can hear the speakers moving once and the place is where hes not in control and the sounds are just so funny theyre funny so funny and it seems to scope it out so you can speak to those words theres sister on the stairs well the 4th of july is over the people are gone and lying the entire house john thought he might do me good to stay with company so he just had mother on the bed and the children down for a nap of course the higher the number of people the geniuses dont know that its a tire john said i should send you to very much of your father i got him into bed very early i had a friend who was with us during his life and she says he was just like john and my brother only more or less besides theres such an interesting conversation you dont feel as if it is worthwhile to turn my hand and go to him in my hand and get him directly in front of the place of course i dont do johns nobody knows john is catching up with me very often to see his kids and junior is good and thats what i know so i walked away with him about a month ago i dont know if i love him or not i sit on the porch and read the wisdoms and i run through and i read that im part of the meaningspighted world perhaps because of the world it smells in my mind so and i read this great unbelievable book its a little game of life and follow that pattern that ive had it is as good as gymnastics i assure you i start i will say at the bottom down in the corner over there where it has not been touched and i determine for the thousandth time that i will follow that deepest pattern to some sort of a conclusion i know a little of the principle of design and i know this thing is not arranged on any laws of radiation or alternation or repetition or symmetry or anything else that ive ever heard of it is repeated of course by the breads but not other breads looked at in one way each bread stands alone the bloated curves and flourishes a kind of debased romanesque with delirium trimmings go waddling up and down in isolated columns of fertility but on the other hand they connect diagonally and the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror like a lot of wallowing seaweeds in full chase the whole thing goes horizontally too at least it seems so i exhaust myself and try to distinguish the order thats going in that direction they have used a horizontal breadth for a freeze and that adds wonderfully to the confusion there is one end of the room where it is almost intact and there when the crosslights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it i can almost fancy radiation after all the interminable growth tests seem to form around the common center and rush off in headlong plunges of peoples destruction it makes me tired to follow it i will take a nap i guess i dont know why i should write this i dont want to i dont feel able and i know john i think that ive served but i must save what i feel and think in some way it is such a relief and the heavens need to be greater than me half the time that i am awfully busy and lie down ever so much john says i mustnt lose my strength and he has me take cod liver oil and lots of tonics and things to say nothing of ale and wine and rare meat dear john he loves me dearly and hates to have me sick i tried to have a real earnest reason to talk with him the other day and tell him how i wish he would let me go and make a visit to cousin henry and julia but he said i wasnt able to go nor able to stand it after i got there and i did not make out a very good case for myself for i was crying before i had finished it is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight just this nervous weakness i suppose and dear john gathered me up in his arms and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed and sat by me and read to me until it tired my head he said i wish his darling and his comfort in all he had and that i must take care of myself for his sake and keep well he says no one but myself can help me out of it that i must use my will and selfcontrol and not let any silly fancies run away with me theres one comfort the baby is well and happy and does not have to occupy this nursery with a horrid wallpaper if we had not used it the blessed child would have what a fortune and escape why i wouldnt have a child of mine an impressionable little thing live in such a room for worlds i never thought of it before but it is lucky that john kept me here after all i can stand it so much easier than a baby you see of course i never mention it to them anymore i am too wise but i keep watching that i have a say in it there are things in that paper that nobody knows but me whatever world behind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day its always the same shape only very new then you just like me warm and sticking down and creaking about behind that pattern i dont like it a bit i wonder i begin to think i wish john would take me away from here its so hard to talk to john about my case because he was so wise because he loves me so but i tried it last night it was moonlight the moon shines in all around just as the sun does i hate to see it sometimes it feels so slow it always comes in at one window at another john was asleep and i hid it to wake him up so i kept staring and watched the moonlight and that insulating wall of paper till i felt creepy the fate for me behind it seemed to shape the pattern just as if she knew i needed it out i got up soft and i went to feel it i see if the paper did move and when i came back john was awake what is it little girl he said dont go walking about like that youll get cold i thought it was a good time to talk so i told him that i really was not gaining him and that i wished he would take me away why darling our lease will be up in three weeks and i cant see how to leave before the repairs are not done at home and i cannot possibly leave town just now of course if you were in any danger i could and would but you really are a better leader whether you can see it or not i am a doctor dear and i know you are gaining flesh and color your appetite is better i thought it really much easier about you i dont weigh a bit more said i nor as much and my appetite may be better in the evening when you are here but it is worse in the morning when you are away bless her little heart said he with a great big hug she shall be as sick as she pleases but now lets improve the shining hours by going to sleep and talk about it in the morning and you wont go away i ask really why how can i dear it is only three weeks more and then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while ginny is getting the house ready really dear you are better better in body perhaps i began and stopped short for he sat up straight and looked at me with such a stern reproachful look that i could not say another word my darling said he i beg of you for my sake and for our childs sake as well as for your own that you will never for one instant let that idea into your mind there is nothing so dangerous so fascinating to a temperament like yours it is a false and foolish fancy can you not trust me as a physician when i tell you so so of course i said no more on that score and we went to sleep for four more minutes he thought i was asleep first but i wasnt and lay there for hours trying to decide whether that front pattern and that back pattern really did move together or separately on a pattern like this like daylight there is a lack of sequence a defiance of law that is a constant irritant to a normal mind the color is hideous enough and unreliable enough and infuriating enough but the pattern is torturing you think you have mastered it but just as soon as you get well underway in following it turns up back somersault and there you are it slaps you in the face knocks you down and tramples upon you this is like a bad dream the outside pattern is a floored arabesque reminding one of the funnels if you can imagine a toadstool in joints an interminable stream of toadstools butting scouting and endless convolutions why that is something like it that is sometimes there is one mark of a familiar and not a familiar but they know by the same standards for myself and that is what changes as the earth changes when the sun shoes in for a first window i always watch that first long straight rain it changes so quickly that i never can quite believe it that is why i watch it all the time by moonlight the moon shines in all night when there is a moon i wouldnt know it is the same paper at night in any kind of light in twilight candlelight lamp light and worst of all by moonlight it becomes bars the outside pattern im in and the woman behind it is as plain as can be i didnt realize for a long time what the thing was that showed behind that dim subpattern but now i am quite sure it is a woman by daylight she is so due quiet i fancy that it is what happens in the future so still and if it doesnt it keeps me quiet by the hour i lie down ever so much john says it is good for me and to sleep all i can he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour to reach me it is a very bad habit i am convinced for you see i dont sleep and that cultivates deceit for i dont tell them im awake oh no the fact is im getting a little afraid of john he seems very queer sometimes and even ginny has an inexplicable look it strikes me occasionally just as a scientific hypothesis that perhaps it is the paper i have watched john and he did not know i was looking and come into the room suddenly on the most innocent excuses and ive caught him several times looking at the paper and ginny too i caught ginny with her hand on it once she didnt know i was in the room and i asked her if i was i thought very well i was but the most restraining thing that possible what she was doing with the paper she turned around as if she had been caught stealing and looked quite angry asked me why i should frighten her so then she said if the paper stained everything it touched she had found yellow smooches on all my clothes and drawings and she wished for me to be more careful did not have some innocent but i know she was studying that pattern and i am determined that nobody shall find it out with myself life is so very much more exciting now than it used to be you see i have something more to expect to look forward to to watch i will do better and im more quiet than i was john is so pleased to see me in the room he laughed a little the other day instead i seen big floors and he spied up my wallpaper i turned it off for a while i have no intention of telling him it was because of the wallpaper he would make fun of me he might even want to take me away i dont want to leave now until i have found it out there is a week more and i think that would be enough im feeling ever so much better but i dont see much at night it is so interesting to watch developments but i see the good deal in the daytime in the daytime im just tired of something for a price there are always new shoots on the fungus and new shades of yellow all in it i cannot keep counting well i have tried to come to an interest but it is as strange as it looks it makes me think of all the yellow things i ever saw the nonbeautiful ones are the rubber cores the old the fat the fat the fat ones theres something else about it the smell i noticed that when it came into the room there was so much air and sun that it was not bright now we have had a week of bother in the room and whether the windows are open or not the smell is still here the trees are all in the house i find it ugly when im dining in the room sculpting in the car hiding in the hall blinding and waiting for me on the stairs it gets in my head even when i go to ride if i turn my head suddenly and surprise it there is that smell its such a peculiar odor too i have spent hours in trying to analyze it to find what it smells like it is not bad at first and very gentle theyre quite the subtlest and most enduring odor ive ever met in this damp weather its awful i wake up in the night and find it all over me it used to disturb me first i thought seriously of burning my house to reach the smell but now im used to it the only thing i can think of is that it is like the color of the paper a yellow smell theres a very plain marker on this one you go down you go up you go straight and around and around it goes behind theres this punch right there long straight even smooch as if it had been rubbed very very thick i wonder how it was done if it did and what they did it for round and round and round round and round and round it makes me dizzy i really have discovered something at last through watching so much at night when it changes so i have finally found it out the front pattern does move and no wonder the woman behind shakes it sometimes i think there are great miniwomen behind and sometimes only one but she calls around fast and her crawling shakes it all over then in very bright spots she pops through and in the very shady spots she just ticks hold of the bars and shakes them hard and shes all the time trying to turn through but nobody can climb through that pattern and stream this out i think that is why it has so many heads they get through and then the pattern strangles them all and turns them upside down and makes their eyes find the those heads are covered and taken off and not found half so bad i think that woman gets out of the daytime and ill tell you what ive seen her i can see her out of every one of the windows it is the same woman i know for she is always creeping and most women do not creep by daylight i see her on that long road under the trees creeping along and when a carriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines i dont blame her a bit it must be very humiliating to be caught creeping by daylight i always lock the door when i creep by daylight i cant do it at night for i know john would suspect something at once and john is so queer now that i dont want to irritate him i wish he would take another room besides i dont want anybody to get that woman at night but myself i often wonder how to save her how to get windows at once but turn as fast as i can i can only see out of one of the tunnel and i always see her she may be able to creep faster than i can turn i have watched her sometimes lay off in the open country creeping as fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind if only that top pattern could have gotten off from the underearth i mean to try it little by little i have found out another funny thing but i shant tell it at this time i does not do the trust people too much there are only two more ways to get this people off of me and i believe john is beginning to get it i dont want people at night and i heard in this gym a lot of professional questions about me she had a very good report to give i saw a slut that you killed john hilt ive seen her before you all are so quiet he asked me all sorts of questions too im pretend that youre very loving and kind as if i couldnt see through him still i dont wonder he acts so sleeping under this paper for three months it only interests me but i feel sure john and jimmy are secretly affected by it hurrah this is the last day but it is enough john is to stay in town overnight and wont be out until this evening jimmy wanted to sleep with me on this slot thing but i told her i should undoubtedly rest better for a night all alone that was clever but i really wasnt alone a bit as soon as it was moonlight and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern i got up and ran to help her i pulled and she shook i shook and she pulled and before morning we had peeled off yards of the paper a strip about as high as my head and half around the room and then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me i declared i would finish it today we go away tomorrow and theyre all moving all my furniture down into many things as they were before jimmy looked at the wall in amazement but i told her merrily that i did it at a pure spike at the vicious thing she laughed and said she wouldnt mind doing it herself but i must not get tired how she betrayed herself that time but i am here and no person touches this paper but me not alive she tried to get me out of the room i was too happy but i said it was so quiet and empty and clean now that i believed i would lie down again and sleep all i could and not to wake me even for dinner i would call when i would so now she is gone and the servants are gone and the things are gone and there is nothing left that great bedstead nailed down into the canvas mattress we found that was we shall sneak downstairs tonight and take the boat home tomorrow i quite enjoyed the room but now there are none how those children did tear about here this bedstead is fairly gnawed but i must get to work i have locked the door and thrown the key down into the compact i dont want to go out and i dont want to have anybody come in until john comes i want to astonish him ive got a rope up here that even ginny did not find if that woman does get out and tries to get away i can tie her but i forgot i could not reach far without anything to stand on this bed will not move i tried to lift and push it until i was lame and then i got so angry i bit off a little piece at one corner but it hurt my teeth then i peeled off all the paper i could reach standing on the floor it sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it all those strangled heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with derision im getting angry enough to do something desperate to jump out of the window with the admirable exercise the bars are too strong even to try besides i wouldnt do it of course not i know well enough that a step like that is improper and might be misconstrued i dont like to even look out of the windows there are so many of those creeping women and they creep so fast i wonder if they all came out of that wallpaper as i did but i am securely fastened now by my wellhidden rope you dont get me out in the road there i suppose i shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes night and that is hard it is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as i please i dont want to go outside i wont even if jenny asked me to for outside you have to creep on the ground and everything is green instead of yellow but here i can creep smoothly on the floor and my shoulder just fits into that long smooch around the wall so i cannot lose my way why theres john at the door its no use young man you cant open it how he does call and pound now hes crying for an axe it would be a shame to break down that beautiful door john dear said i in the gentlest voice the key is down by the front steps under a plantain leaf that silence told him for a few moments then he said very quietly indeed open the door my darling i cant said i the key is down by the front door under a plantain leaf and then i said it again several times very gently and slowly and said it so often that he had to go and see and he got it of course and came in he stopped short by the door what is the matter he cried for gods sake what are you doing i kept on creeping just the same but i looked at him over my shoulder ive got out at last said i in spite of you and jenny and ive pulled off most of the paper so you cant put me back now why should the man have fainted but he did and right across my path by the wall so that i had to creep over him every time end of the yellow wallpaper by charlotte perkins
