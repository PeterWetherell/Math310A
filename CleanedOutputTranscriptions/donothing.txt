 theres a lot of people who are in the bathroom no one will show that theres very slowly in here ordinary people like john and myself so theyre in such a hard time listening a colonial mansion of hereditary estate i would say a haunted house and it was the height of her manic層 but that would be asking too much of a fate still no crowd would be clear that theres that in fear thats why i ought to admit that so cheaply and why her streets are long and timid john laughs at me at once but one expects that in marriage john is practical in the extreme he has no patience with faith and intense horror superstition and hes got openly at any talk of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures john is a physician and perhaps i would not say to a living soul of course but this is dead paper and id like to live to my mind perhaps that is one reason i did not get well faster and you see he does not believe i am sick and what can i do but the physician and i sit in the bed and what is his own husband the streets are framed and religious the bed is really nothing in that over there but temporary nervous depression a slight despair of ten minutes and what is going to happen my brother is also a physician im also a high student and he says the same thing hes a very deep phosphate of bossstyles whatever it is and journeys and eggs exercise and absolutely everything for good and good work in relying well again personally i disagree with what i do personally i believe that continue with excitement and change and if doing it good what is one to do i did write for a fine spiderlike but it does i think this is a slide i sometimes fancy that my condition if i had less opposition and more society and stimulus the john says the very worst thing i can do is think about my condition and i confess it always makes me feel bad so i will let it alone and talk about the house the most beautiful place it is quite alone standing well back from the road quite three miles from the village it makes me think of english placing that you read about but there are hedges and walls and dates that walk and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people there is a delicious garden i never saw such a garden large and shady full of boxboughted paths and lime with longblood covered arborage and the house seats under them there are green houses too but they are all broken now there was some legal trouble i did here something about the hairs and cohandlers in the place that i have been for years that spoils my ghosting and same frame but i dont care there is something strange about this i can feel it i even said so to john he said that i felt his little drop and he said im sure i never used to be so sensitive i think it is due to this nervous condition but john says that by feel so i should neglect proper selfcontrol so i take things to control myself before him he said that makes me very tired i dont know why i thought really about this i want to learn about this because i feel like im really tired i want to learn about this because i feel like im really tired i want to learn about this because i feel like im not tired and how creo is it now i do not know what it is going to be and such pretty old fashioned chipsman john asked me to do it this is what goes to my hand oh not really this is what goes to my hand no no im not really fine im just taking up this is great and i think thats my strength and special courage and this is your description for each color he takes all your care for me and so not for you basically im pretty full of your power he said we came here so young if i was to have perfect rest and all the air i could get your exercise depends on your strength my fear and your food somewhat on your appetite but ever you can absorb all the time so we took the nursery at the top of the house it is a big airing in the whole floor in the air with windows that look all the way in the air and sunshine below it was nursery first and then play room in the nation as you judge but the windows are barred for the children and there are means that things belong to the walls the paint on paper look as if a boys school had used it it is stripped off the paper in great patches all around the head of my bed about as far as i can i never saw it in the air you know the square flamboyant having a pretty every artistic style you know youre not using your own body you have to constantly irritate and provoke study and when you follow the main uncertain curves you need a distance they suddenly commit suicide plend off at outrageous angles destroy themselves and then herd of contradictions the color is repellent almost forgotten a smoldering uncream yellow strungly faded by the slouching sun i dont know theyre all in some places sickly selfretent notice no wonder the children painted it i should hate it myself i had to live in this room long i was happy to see it i didnt even turn right away youve been here two days i havent felt right youre sitting by the window up in the staccrocious and merciless way nothing to ignore my right is much as i think i say black stroke john is the way old even some nights been to this place for years im glad in my close to my face these nervous troubles are out to let me confess john does not know how much i really suffered he knows there is no reason to suffer but not satisfied sir of course it is only nervousness it does weigh on me so not to do my duty in any way i meant to be such a help to john such a real rest and comfort and here i am a comparative burden already no one would believe what an evidently is im not a terrible person it is fortunate mary is so good with it such a dearly yet i cannot it makes me so nervous i said john is never in my business life he left me so about this world better i first eventually broke with one of my parents but afterwards he said that i was letting it get better from me and there is nothing in this world for a more despist and to give way such chances they said that after the war they were just too much to know they would have made it even better and then they barred with it and then they gave it better for the spirits and so you know the places during the war and really did it i dont care to renovate the house just for a 31 sprint then do that as for the other stairs there are such pretty timings there then you took me in this apartment called the press of grim reaper and then you took me in this apartment and then you took me in this apartment and then you took me in this apartment and then you took me in this apartment and then you took me in this apartment and then you took me in this apartment and then you took me in this apartment and then you took me in this apartment and then you took me in this apartment and then you took me in this apartment and then you took me in this apartment and then you took me in this apartment and then you took me in this apartment and now you take me to and you took me in this apartment and then you took me and then you took me in now you are not that private group a long period of state there is a beautiful sheevi君 that doesnt work on minors i will only run to my favorite league the first time in the world but i found it a pretty time and its so distilled im not gonna have any advice from any trip about my life when i get really well john said he has something to do with that and im going visit him and says he will soon get fired as my cookers as to let me have those familiar people out here im gonna show you how to do that but i must not think about that this paper next to me is a bit new for the british history theres a recurrence spot in it having a look in it perhaps you can go this far i get positively angry when it pertains to it and the everlastingness of the downing side is the call and those absurd and confusing eyes are everywhere theres one little place for two breaths and the eyes will all up and down the line and the little time of another we have a sauce and a little suppression in the downwater and we all know how much expression the sky waves the shadow and the moment it came the moment the wind blows the next turn the next turn i remember the tiny wind the noise about the good old views the noise about the sun the sun the wind is the good the wind is the good this dark went down a lot by the wind lets cut them down finish them in this window to no worse the üzering out lets do a few steps thats the purpose in this museum that the encounter may have to take in your son and moms body and no wonder im never saw such guidance was of the childrens have laid here the wall surface is turned off in socks and its sticking close to the ground and its sticking close to the ground and its sticking close to the ground and its sticking close to the ground and its sticking close to the ground and its sticking close to the ground and its sticking close to the ground and its sticking close to the ground and its sticking close to the ground and its sticking close to the ground and its sticking close to the ground and its sticking close to the ground and it actually sticks close to the ground whats on with this thing that is supposed toax it electrons and gauges theres rubbish and thats just how much and killer it is as good as gymnastics i assure i start and i say at the bottom down in the corner over there where it has not been touched and i determine for the thousandth time that i will follow that as having to some sort of a conclusion i know a little of the principle of design and i know this thing is not arranged on any laws of radiation or alteration or repetition or symmetry or anything else that ive ever heard of it has repeated of course i never did that but not looked at in one way its breath stands away the bloated curves and foreshes i kind of debase romanesque with delirium trimmings go waddling up and down in isolated columns of faturity but on the other hand they connect diagonally and the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting waves up to car like a lot of wallowing seaweed and full chase the whole thing goes horizontally too at least at the same side that exhaust myself and try to distinguish the order and its goal in the direction they have used a horizontal breath for a freeze and that adds wonderfully to the confusion there is one end of the room where it is almost intact and there when the crosslights fade and the loose sun shines directly at the planet i can almost fancy radiation after all the interminable group tests seem to form around the common scene and rush off in a heavy long pond with an equal destruction and makes it a time to follow it i will take a nap right now i dont know why i should write this i dont want to i dont feel able and i know john did that absurd but i must say what i feel you can suddenly get to such relief you never need to be afraid you will be able and half the time i am off and ride down ever so much john says i must have been his master and here as we take codeniver or and lots of tonic some things to say nothing ailing wine a little meat dear john he loves and a deal and hates to have himself i tried to have a real earnest reason to talk with him the other day and tell him how i wish you would let me go and make a visit to cousin henry and julia but he said i wasnt able to go nor able to stand it after i got there and i did not make out a very good case for myself for i was crying before i had finished it is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight just this nervous weakness i suppose and dear john gathered me up in his arms and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed and sat by me and read to me until i heard my head he said i was his darling i was comforted and all of you had and that i must take care of myself for his sake and keep well he says no one but myself can help me out of it that i must use my real and selfcontrol and not let any silly fencees run away with me theres one comfort the baby is well and happy and does not have to occupy this nursery with a hoarded wall of paper if we had not used it the blessed child would have what a fortune in a scape why i wouldnt have a child of mine and impressionable little thing live in such a room for worlds i never thought of it before but it is lucky that john kept me here after all i can stand it so much easier than a baby you see of course i never mentioned it to the new one i am too wise i could actually watch it all the same there are things in that paper and nobody knows from me i have a world behind that outside pattern the damn shapes get clearer every day its always the same shape only very new and just like in the one just keeping down and breaking about the one that pattern i dont like it that i wonder how to get into the pink i wish john would take me away from here its a hard time to john in my case because he was so wise because he wasnt so but that turned him right he was new now the new shines in all around just the same way i think the same thing happens he was so slow all his comes in by one million dollars john was asleep and i hit it to waking him so i kept still and watched the moon line up and you laid in your eye i hope you were tired for a few days i think he was very pretty behind that same shape pattern just a picture on it i thought i was so happy i see that the paper didnt even and when i came back john was awake what is this little girl who said dont go walking about like that you get cold i thought it was a good time to talk so i told him that really was not in and i wished he would take me away why darling i at least would be up in three weeks and i cant see how to be before there are pairs not done at home and i cannot possibly be down just now of course if you were in any danger i could and would but you really are better here whether you can see or not im a doctor here i know youre gaining flesh and color your appetite is better i thought it really much easier about you i thought it would have bits more said i more is much and my appetite may be better in the evening when you are here but it is worse in the morning you are awake bless her little heart said he would a great big hug she shall be at sick as she pleases but now lets improve the shining hours by going to sleep ill talk about it in the morning and you want to go away i asked will you why how can i dear it is only three weeks more and then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while ginny is getting the house ready really dear you are better better in body perhaps i began to start short for a set up straight and looked at me with such a stern reproachful look that i could not say another word my darling said he id better be for my second four child soon as well as for your own but you will never for one instant let that idea into your mind there is nothing so dangerous so fascinating to a temperament like yours it is a false and foolish fancy can you not trust me as a physician who i tell you so sir of course i said no more on that spot and we went to sleep for a while he thought i was a sleep first he thought i was a sleeper and later for hours trying to decide for that front pad and that pad really did we together or separate on a pad in like this like they were at there is a lack of secrets had the fines of law there is a constant irritant to a normal mind the color is hideous enough and unreliable enough and infuriating enough with the patterns to fortune thank you and master but just as soon as you get well underway and following it turns up back to summer salt and there you are it slaps you in the face knocks you down and tramples it on you this is like a bad dream the outside pad runs a florida arab bus reminding one of the funnels if you can imagine a towed stool and joints an internal stream of towed stools but in this kind of motion right that is something like it that is sometimes there is one mark there is one mark there is one mark there is a chain of tows there is a chain of tows and the sun shits in its true now all these watchers have first floor its a very strange way its in just so quickly that i never can quite believe it that is why i want to watch it all but im going to the moon shines in all night there is a moon i wouldnt know it was the same paper and night and the kind of light and its bright light chandler light and the night light and worse than all of the moon light it becomes bars the outside pattern and the woman behind it as his plan is convenient but i didnt realize for a long time and why is the show behind that dim sub pattern but now i have quite sure it is a woman but they are just so do quite ive been listening to some pattern im so still and i said doesnt it keep me quiet by the hour i lie down every so much john says it was good for me and to see all i can he started to have it im looking me lie down and how much more it is a very bad habit i have ive convinced for you see i dont see it and that cultivates deceit if i dont tell them im awake oh no the fact is im getting a little afraid of john he seems very clear sometimes and even ginny has an inexplicable look it strikes me occasionally and just as a scientific hypothesis that perhaps it is the paper i have watched john and he did not know i was looking and come into the room suddenly on the most innocent excuses and ive caught him several times looking at the paper and ginny too i caught ginny with her hand on it once she didnt know i was in the room and then i asked her and then i asked her she was thrown in the room and she was doing the paper she turned around so she had been caught sleeping and looked quite angry as me while i was your frightened herself and she said the paper stayed everything at touch she had found a little smudges on all my clothes and jeans and she was so beautiful did my hands stand in the kitchen but i know she was studying that pattern and i am determined that nobody should find out with myself life is so very much more exciting now than it used to be you see i have something more to expect to get forward to watch i really dont know about it and im more quiet than it was ginny is so pleased to see me through and im not going to be able to bear it and say i seem to be a poor person hes probably not going to walk i turned around and i have no intention to find him he was a bit tired of the walk he would make fun of me he might even want to take me away i dont want to leave now until i found him out there is a week more and i think that would be enough im feeling ever so much better i dont see much of night but its so interesting to watch the developments but i think a bit later on im not going to be able to and they tell me its a tyrosine for the first time there are always new shoots on the funnest and new shows that youre all going to find i can not keep trying to im trying to come to you but it is a strange moment and its going to be a big problem its a big problem and im going to be the one who has a lot of things and im going to be the one who has a lot of things theres something else about it its snow and notice the commute between us and the room theres so much air in the snow and now weve had a huge problem and quite a bit of wind is open or not were so excited and its really snow i need to cover the wind down im still feeling a power i need to hide in the car i need to make sure that its in the car even when i go to ride if i turn my head suddenly in surprises there is that smell such a peculiar odor too i have spent hours in trying to analyze it to find what its snowing it is not bad and first and very gentle take quite the sun the most thing during the ride ever met and this damp weather is often i wake up in the night and find a new and im used to the storm first i thought seriously i already had this to reach the snow but now im used to it the only thing i can think of is that it is like the colour of the paper a yellow snow theres a very plain lot on the snow im just going to go to the snow the street on the ground it goes beyond the mountains its a pretty sunny day so im so scared im so scared im so scared im so scared as if it had been rough i really couldnt i wonder how it was done im afraid im not very good at this round and round and round round and round and round it makes me dizzy i really had discovered something about this he was watching so much it might be changed im finally found it out the foot pattern does move and no wonder the woman behind shakes it sometimes i think i have a great mini room behind sometimes im going to the one but she calls her out fast and her phone shakes it all over and then in the very front side she just takes her to the bars and shakes them hard and shes all the time trying to handle her but nobody can find her that pattern its extremely sunny and thats where it has so many heads they get through and then the pattern strangles them all it turns them upside down and makes it worse but the ground goes ahead the cover will take them off and not that bad its a bad thing i think that woman did time the day time im not telling you off ive seen her i just see her at the very one of the windows it is the same woman i know for she is always creeping and most women do not creep by daylight i see her on the wrong road under the trees creeping along and when a carriage comes she hides under the white light and when a carriage comes she hides under the whiteberry vines i dont blame her a bit it must be very humiliated to be caught creeping like they got i know its not the door im worried about daylight i cant do it at night for i know john is suspect something was and john is so clear now but i dont want to irritate him wish you would take him out yeah im sorry i dont know i dont want to be like that woman i dont want to be like that woman i dont want you i dont want to be like that i dont want to be like that it turns asses i can like you see it i dont want to be like that i dont want to be like that she may be able to creep faster than i can turn ive watched her sometimes away often the open country creeping as an actor and ill shadow in her high wind im going to talk to him weve gotten off from the other i need to try it well go by him i found another funny thing but i shot tell him this time it does not do a little trespassing too much but i only tell you its me and my mom ive really done it i dont want to hear what that is and i couldnt just tell him a lot of professional questions about him shes got a very good report to do shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report shes got a smart report im just going to find an electronics downtown itll only enter a signal but i feel sure john gerry no secretly affected by it rob this is the last day that it is enough john is to stay in town overnight and will be out until the same evening damien gone and proceeded to meet me to a slot but i told her i should undoubtedly waste better for a night alone that was clever but i really wasnt alone a bit as soon as it was moonlight and that four thing began to crawl and shake the pattern i got up and ran to help her i pulled and she shook i shook and she pulled and before morning we had peeled off yards of the paper i stripped about as high as my head and half around the room and then when the sun came and that off of pattern began to laugh at me i declared i would finish it today we go away tomorrow and theyre all moving all my furniture down in time many things as they were before jeannie looked at the wall in the maize me but i told her merely that didnt have a pure spite of the vicious thing she laughed and said she wouldnt mind doing it herself but i must not get tired how she betrayed herself at time but i am here and no person touches this paper but me not alive she tried to get me out of the room but i said so quiet and i think you can now lovely that would lie down again she called like her im not too waking even for dinner i would call her so now she has gone and the servants are gone and the things are gone and theres nothing left that great bed stand nailed down and the cameras were not chosen from them it was just a downstairs table it took the book home to my wife my children how those children did tear about here this bed stand is fairly not but i am just going to work i have walked it over and thrown the truth down to the table i dont want to go out and i dont want to have anybody come in until john comes i want to go stonge ive got a rope here i think even ginny did not find if that woman does get out and tries to get away i can tie her but i forgot i could not reach far without anything to stand on this bed will not move i tried to lift and push it until i was lame and then i got so angry i bit off a little piece at one corner but it hurt my teeth then i peeled off all the paper i could reach standing on the floor it sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it all those strangled heads and bowled this eyes and waddling fungus gross just shriek with derision im getting angry and up to do something desperate to jump out the window with the admirable exercise the bar is too strong even to try im not sure if i can get the exercise i wouldnt do it of course not i know well enough that a step like that is improper and might mean this construit i dont like to even look out of the windows there are so many of those creeping women in the creeps so fast i wonder if they all came out of that wall paper as i did but i am securely fastened now but i will hit the rope you dont get me out of the room as a close i shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes night and that is hard it is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as i please i dont want to go outside i want even if you ask me to froude side you have to creep on the ground and everything is green instead of yellow but here i can creep smoothly on the floor and my shoulder just fits into that long smoothing around the wall so i cannot lose my way why there is john at the door it is no usual man you cant open it how he does call and film now he is crying for an axe he would be ashamed to break down that beautiful door john dear said i in the genitalist voice the key is down by the front steps under a plantain leaf that sounds tone for a few moments then he said very quietly indeed open the door my darling i cant say that i the key is down by the front door under a plantain leaf and then i said it again several times very gently and slowly and said it so often that he had to go and see i didnt got it of course and came in he stopped short by the door what is the matter he cried for gods sake what are you doing i kept on creeping just the same but i looked at him over my shoulder i have got out at last said i in spite of you and jenny and i pulled off most of the paper so you cant put me back now why should the man have fainted what he did and ran across my path by the wall so that i had to creep over him every time end of the yellow wallpaper by charlotte perkins gilman recorded by alan lough thomasville alabama october 20 don 7833 6 they
